== Summary ==
Roll out of wmf.8 to group1 broke the world.

=== Detection ===
Initial indicators of the issue were picked up in logstash and via logspam-watch on mwlog1001.  A large number of Icinga alerts followed.

It seems likely that the primary issue was obscured during the initial deploy by a focus on Parsoid errors.

== Timeline ==
All times in UTC.

* 20:12 brennen: Train wmf.8 roll fowards from group0 to group1 as well (try 1) 
* 20:12 Large amounts of logspam noticed, especially from Parsoid/PHP, and Icinga issues many alerts.
* 20:28 brennen: Train wmf.8 rolled back to just group0 

[Fixes to exclude Parsoid/PHP]
