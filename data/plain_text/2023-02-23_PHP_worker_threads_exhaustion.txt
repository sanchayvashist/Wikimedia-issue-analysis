== Summary ==


db1127 was too busy to respond even to the simple statistics queries that the mysql prometheus exporter runs. The MariaDB query killer has a bug in 10.6.10 where queries were not properly killed. This was fixed in 10.6.12. db1127 was one of the remaining hosts to still be on 10.6.10.
