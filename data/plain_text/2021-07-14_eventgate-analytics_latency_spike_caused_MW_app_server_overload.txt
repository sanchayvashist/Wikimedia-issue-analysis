 

== Summary ==
While working on updating EventGate to support Prometheus, Andrew Otto deployed the changes to eventgate-analytics in codfw (then-active DC).  This change removed the prometheus-statsd-exporter container in favor of direct Prometheus support, as added in recent versions of service-runner and service-template-node.

The deploy went fine in the idle "staging" and "eqiad" clusters, but when deploying to codfw, request latency from MediaWiki to eventgate-analytics spiked, which caused PHP worker slots to fill up, which in turn caused some MediaWiki API requests to fail.

The helm tool noticed that the eventgate-analytics deploy to codfw itself was not doing well, and auto-rolled back the deployment:


$ kube_env eventgate-analytics codfw; helm history production

Impact: For ~10 minutes, MediaWiki API clients experienced request failures.

* Figure out why this happened and fix.  Based on this log message, it seems likely that a bug in the service-runner prometheus integration caused the nodejs worker process to die. [DONE]
** Further investigation uncovered that require('prom-client') within a worker causes the observed issue.  Both service-runner and node-rdkafka-prometheus require prom-client.  It was proposed to patch  node-rdkafka-prometheus to handle passing in the prom-client instance. 
** node-rdkafka-prometheus is an unmaintained project, so we have forked it to @wikimedia/node-rdkafka-propetheus and fixed the issue there.  Additionally, if this issue in prom-client is fixed, we probably won't need the patch we made to node-rdkafka-prometheus for this fix.
