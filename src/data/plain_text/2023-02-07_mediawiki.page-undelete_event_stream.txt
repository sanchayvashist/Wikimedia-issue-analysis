== Summary ==



We are not aware of all consumers of this stream.  No one noticed this change for over 3 months.  

Root Cause

The developer (Andrew Otto) and reviewers did not catch the accidental change to extension.json that unregistered the EventBusHooks:onPageUndelete hook handler.

Affected Datasets and Services

The main fallout is that WDQS and WCQS will have inconsistencies in their downstream datastores: any wiki pages that were undeleted during this time period will not be available in WDQS. There may be exceptions to this, the WDQS updater is supposed to detect inconsistencies (i.e. getting an edit on a deleted page) and apply some reconciliation but apparently this system did not work as expected here. Resolving the inconsistencies for WDQS will be achieved via full data-reload (something that was already in progress).

There may be other affected services as well.  The event.mediawiki_page_undelete table in Hive will be empty for this time.  We also expose this stream publicly via stream.wikimedia.org, so if there are external consumers (Internet Archive?) they will also have missed these page undelete events.



==Timeline==
All times in UTC.

*2022-10-31 Andrew Otto merges a change to EventBus extension that causes mediawiki.page-undelete events to not be sent.  This is deployed over the next week as part of the MediaWiki deployment train.
*2023-02-07 - A user reports inconsistencies in WDQS results.  David Cause asks Andrew Otto about any known issues with mediawiki.page-undelete.
*2023-02-07 - Andrew Otto discovers the mistake, pushes a fix, and has the fix deployed in a backport deploy window.
*2023-02-07 -  OUTAGE ENDS

==Actionables==

* Add automated stream throughput alerting: T329070
* Review the “reconciliation” mechanism of the WDQS updater to understand why it was not able to recover these missing events after further edits on the affected entities and fix it: T329089
