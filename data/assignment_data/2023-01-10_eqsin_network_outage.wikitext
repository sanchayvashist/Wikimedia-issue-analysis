<!-- Reminder: No private information on this page! -->eqsin is connected to the core DCs via two transport links, one of them has been suffering a long fiber cut (see [[phab:T322529|T322529]]) the other one went down due to a planned maintenance from the transport provider. 

For ~11min (+ the time user's DNS resolvers pick up eqsin depool, long tail up to 30min) users normally redirected to eqsin (mostly in the APAC region) were only able to read Wikipedia pages already cached in eqsin.{{TOC|align=right}}

<mark>Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? Was the alert volume manageable?</mark> 

Yes, the appropiate alerts fired.

No, the alert volume was hard to handle on IRC and 3 pages triggered at the same time, two of them escalated to batphone.

<mark>Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible?</mark>

Yes.

<mark>TODO: If human only, an actionable should probably be to "add alerting".</mark>
A flood of host down alerts usually mean a network related issue.
==Conclusions ==

<mark>OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)</mark>

===What went well?===

* Site was depooled quickly. "depool first, investigate later" was the correct attitude to adopt
* Automated monitoring detected the issue

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc</mark>

===What went poorly?===

* eqsin stayed too long with a single operational transport link
* The overlapping transport links downtime were not caught by SREs
* The planned maintenance of the provider was not in a task/reminder

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc</mark>

===Where did we get lucky?===

* The outage happened when many SREs were connected

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc</mark>

==Links to relevant documentation==

* …

<mark>Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.</mark>

==Actionables==

* Create a backup GRE tunnel - https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T327265
* Ensure the long down transport link comes back up properly once fixed - https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T322529
* Automatically parse maintenance notifications and alert on conflicting maintenance - https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T230835

<mark>Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.</mark>

<mark>Add the [[phab:project/view/4758/|#Sustainability (Incident Followup)]] and the [[phab:project/profile/4626/|#SRE-OnFIRE (Pending Review & Scorecard)]]  Phabricator tag to these tasks.</mark>
