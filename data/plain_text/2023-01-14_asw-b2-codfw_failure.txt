== Summary ==


…

Switch asw-b2-codfw failed; asw-b-codfw master failed over to b7 as designed. This, however, left all the systems in B2 offline. A volunteer noticed the alerts, and used Klaxon. We were unable to restore asw-b2-codfw to service, and depooled the swift and thanos frontends in B2. This left us operational, but at reduced redundancy. 

A further complication was that lvs2008 reaches all of row B via asw-b2-codfw, which meant that trying to change things in codfw on Monday was difficult; as a result of which mediawiki in codfw was depooled until asw-b2-codfw could be replaced.



==Timeline==

All times in UTC.

*08:18 asw-b2-codfw fails, hosts in B2 alert as DOWN OUTAGE BEGINS
*08:21 asw-b-codfw.mgmt.codfw.wmnet - virtual-chassis crash alert
*08:28 asw-b-codfw.mgmt.codfw.wmnet recovered from virtual-chassis crash [failover to B7 complete?]
*08:35 volunteer (RhinosF1) pings a SRE on IRC (_joe_)
*08:43 volunteer opens https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T327001 at UBN
*08:58 second volunteer (taavi) announces they will Klaxon
*09:01 VO pages batphone
*09:08 first SRE (godog) responds
*09:17 Emperor depools ms-fe-2010 and thanos-fe2001
*09:47 having determined we don't have a switchable PDU that would enable a powercycle, godog issues `request system reboot member 2` as a last-ditch attempt to restart the failed device. This fails.
*10:00 godog emails dc-ops about the failure, noting lack of user impact; notes SRE can't remote power-cycle the device, suggests it can probably wait until Monday, asks for confirmation.
*10:21 XioNoX confirms switch console nonresponsive, all remote options exhausted, next step is replace and RMA switch (since even if we could power it back on at this point, it should be considered likely-to-fail-again).
*10:38 confirmed normal operations with reduced redundancy, no further action needed until next business day OUTAGE ENDS
*18:48 replacement switch put into place, but not configured

==Detection==

Automated monitoring detected the outage, a human made the decision to Klaxon.

The initial DOWN alerts came before alerting picked up the switch failure; in an ideal world we would have picked up the switch failure and not separately alerted about the dependent hosts.

It's not clear if a switch failing should page, given we are able to continue without one.

===What went well?===

* Switch failure worked as designed
* Correct redundancy arrangements of hosts & services, thus:
* No user impact

===What went poorly?===

* The runbook wasn't linked directly from the alert and thus wasn't found by first responders
* Escalation path (DCops manager) not clear on how to engage codfw smart hands out of hours (though in fact doing so wouldn't have been necessarily the right thing to do)
* Manually-generated page (which is either poor because it should have paged automatically, or poor because a volunteer felt they had to manually page SREs at the weekend when actually it could have waited until NBD, so comms / docs need to be better)
* We effectively lost more than 1 LVS
