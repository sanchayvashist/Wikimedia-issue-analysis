== Summary ==
Today at 11:41 the icinga check for `ms-fe.svc.codfw.wmnet` timed out and thus paged (and recovered three minutes later):

Users in codfw/ulsfo/eqsin have experienced ~15min of higher latency (possibly timeouts) for hit-local and miss requests (10-25% of the site's requests, depending on the site).

Specifically hitting <tt>/monitoring/backend</tt> timed out, this in turn meant that some of the backend server(s) where the <tt>monitoring</tt> container lives were slow/unhealthy.
Case in point <tt>ms-be2033.codfw.wmnet</tt> was reported as slow from <tt>/var/log/swift/server.log</tt> on e.g. <tt>ms-fe2006.codfw.wmnet</tt>:

The slowness was induced by an earlier swift rebalance ({{Bug|T272837}}) and the way we do rebalances at the moment means that such operations are generally noisy/impactful to the cluster (e.g. {{Bug|T221904}}, {{Bug|T271415}}). Swift has been depooled internally from its discovery record (essentially anticipating {{Bug|T267338}}).


== Actionables ==

* Change <code>/monitoring/backend</code> to <code>/monitoring/frontend</code> (i.e. check the frontend itself) for icinga service check and pybal's proxyfetch {{Bug|T273453}}
* Consider depooling swift's discovery records during rebalances {{Bug|T273453}}
