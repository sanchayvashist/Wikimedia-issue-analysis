== Summary ==



A large influx in requests led to excessive thread pool usage from codfw blazegraph backends, with concomitant increases in CPU load and throttling filter state size. This triggered a known bug in Blazegraph where its improper thread management leads to deadlock.

The system self healed, perhaps due to application-level throttling state throttling the offender.

Most or all CODFW-routed wdqs requests during the incident window failed.

2022-12-12 20:25:00 Rough end of incident (end of user impact)

2022-12-12 20:31:00 [WDQS] ryankemper@cumin2002:~$ sudo -E cumin -b 4 wdqs2* 'systemctl restart wdqs-blazegraph' By this point, the service had already recovered, but was restarted out of an abundance of caution.

==Detection==

The issue was rapidly detected by pybal monitoring of WDQS. A page was emitted by the monitoring system fairly quickly.

==Conclusions ==

OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)

===What went well?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc

===What went poorly?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc

===Where did we get lucky?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc

==Links to relevant documentation==

* The wdqs codfw dashboard shows a large spike in queries for wdqs2*, with a corresponding increase in CPU load and the throttling filter state.
