== Summary ==


…

The mw-page-content-change-enrich (flink) app is failing to start in eqiad (passive DC because of a network timeout on a dependent service (thanos-swift) https://logstash.wikimedia.org/goto/ce1765e186329ed74f179d375f8df182.

The app needs swift for HA. The connection failure caused the k8s operator to fail startup. The incident was caused by incorrect egress rules. Since the app is DC agnostic, egress rules must be set for both DCs ip ranges for all deployments.

This issue was fixed by applying the proper egress rules, a re-deploying the application. The active DC deployment was not affected.

There was no user visible outage.
==Detection==
Alerts where fired based on prometheus metrics. 

The issue was escalated to the DRI.

==Conclusions ==

* there was no user visible outage.
* only passive DC was affected.
* mw-page-content-change-enrich egress rules to thanos were misconfigured.
* we never encountered this issue before, because swift-thanos was pooled in both eqiad and codfw.
* during DC switchover swift-thanos was depooled from eqiad.
* the network route issue manifested.

===What went well?===

* gehel was proactive in escalating the incident to the DRI.
* instrumentation and logs supported troubleshooting.
* claime (#wikimedia-data-persistence) promptly helped to triage the issue.

===What went poorly?===

* lead time to escalation could have been shorter.
* Early critical alerts went unnoticed by the application DRIs.

===Where did we get lucky?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc

==Links to relevant documentation==

* …

Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.

==Actionables==

* …

Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.

Add the #Sustainability (Incident Followup) and the #SRE-OnFire  Phabricator tag to these tasks.
