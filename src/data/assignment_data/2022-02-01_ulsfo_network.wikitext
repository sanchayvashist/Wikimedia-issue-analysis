A firewall change was pushed to ulsfo routers, which caused [[ulsfo]] to lose connectivity to the other POPs and core sites for 3min.

== Timeline ==
* 16:03 - apply [[gerrit:c/operations/homer/public/+/748098/3|configuration change]] on cr3-ulsfo
* 16:05 - apply [[gerrit:c/operations/homer/public/+/748098/3|configuration change]] on cr4-ulsfo - '''outage starts'''
* 16:06 - Icinga notifies about connectivity issues to ulsfo - '''paging'''
* 16:08 - change rolled back - '''outage ends'''

'''Root cause:'''

The change incorrectly restricts [[:en:Bidirectional_Forwarding_Detection|BFD]] to BGP peers:<syntaxhighlight lang="diff">
+      term allow_bfd {
+          from {
+              source-prefix-list {
+                  bgp-sessions;
+              }
+              protocol udp;
+              port 3784-3785;
+          }
+          then accept;
+      }
</syntaxhighlight>While BFD is also used by OSPF sessions, which caused them to be tear down.

One surprising point is that the issue didn't show up in the verification commands (<code>show ospf interfaces</code>, <code>show ospf neighbors</code>), all neighbors are present.<syntaxhighlight lang=text>
show ospf interface   

Interface           State   Area            DR ID           BDR ID          Nbrs

ae0.2               PtToPt  0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0            1

et-0/0/1.401        PtToPt  0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0            1

xe-0/1/1.0          PtToPt  0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0            1

show ospf neighbor    

Address          Interface              State     ID               Pri  Dead

198.35.26.197    ae0.2                  Full      198.35.26.193    128    35

198.35.26.199    et-0/0/1.401           Full      198.35.26.194    128    33

198.35.26.209    xe-0/1/1.0             Full      208.80.154.198   128    34
</syntaxhighlight>While it was effectively down:

<code>rpd[16292]: RPD_OSPF_NBRDOWN: OSPF neighbor 198.35.26.209 (realm ospf-v2 xe-0/1/1.0 area 0.0.0.0) state changed from Full to Down due to InActiveTimer (event reason: BFD session timed out and neighbor was declared dead)</code>

== Conclusion ==
* More progressive roll out (longer wait time between each routers, as well as fewer changes at a time) could have reduced the risk of the issue happening
* Monitoring properly caught the issue
