== Summary ==
On Sunday 5th at 11:22UTC, the primary hard drive of cr3-eqsin (one of the two Singapore POP routers) crashed.
This caused the router to reboot into its second disk, containing only a factory default configuration. Everything failed over cleanly to the redundant router.

Impact: We lost at max ~15000 requests/s in a 7min window (see screenshot, and graph).



== Timeline ==
All times in UTC.

* 11:22 PROBLEM - Host cr3-eqsin is DOWN: PING CRITICAL - Packet loss = 100% (paging) OUTAGE BEGINS
* 11:25 SREs reports of connectivity issues to eqsin (too brief to trigger alerting)
* 11:27 Routing is done converging, no more reports of connectivity issue OUTAGE ENDS
* 11:35 DNS patch ready to depool eqsin (just in case, unused) - https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/dns/+/609571/

Monday 06
* ~07:40 Router is brought back up on its backup disk Redundancy restored

== Detection ==

* Was automated monitoring first to detect it? Yes
* Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? Yes
* PROBLEM - Host cr3-eqsin is DOWN: PING CRITICAL - Packet loss = 100% (paging alert)
* Was the alert volume manageable? Yes, only relevant alerts fired
* Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible? Yes, the router went down, and only the router down paging alert triggered

== Conclusions ==
* This outage showed that our hardware redundancy and failover are solid
* Juniper recently introduced a new feature: vmhost snapshot that would have prevented the lack of redundancy (but not the crash itself)

=== What went well? ===
* Everything failed over as expected to the redundant router

=== What went poorly? ===
* N/A

=== Where did we get lucky? ===
* N/A

=== How many people were involved in the remediation? ===
* 2 SREs investigating the issue, multiple SREs reported present to the page
