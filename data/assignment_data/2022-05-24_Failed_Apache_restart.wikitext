* A Puppet change seem to have caused an apache restart https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/puppet/+/798615/ that didn’t work as it made it listen 443 regardless whether mod_ssl is enabled
** Alerts: connect to address 10.X.X.X and port 80: Connection refused | CRITICAL - degraded: The following units failed: apache2.service
** Puppet was quickly disabled to prevent a site-wide outage (apache failing everywhere affected)
** Initial triage was done via cumin: ''sudo cumin -m async 'mw1396*' 'sed -i"" "s/Listen 443//" /etc/apache2/ports.conf '  'systemctl start apache2 '''  as the patch revert didn’t work.
** The final fix: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/puppet/+/798631/

'''All times in UTC.'''

* 11:40 <nowiki>https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/puppet/+/798615/</nowiki> gets merged

* 11:45 INCIDENT STARTS ​​<+jinxer-wm> (ProbeDown) firing: Service kibana7:443 has failed probes (http_kibana7_ip4) #page - [[Network monitoring#ProbeDown|https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Network_monitoring#ProbeDown]] - https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/O0nHhdhnz/network-probes-overview?var-job=probes/service&var-module=http - https://alerts.wikimedia.org/?q=alertname%3DProbeDown

* 11:45 John realises the patch broke apaches across mw hosts
* 11:45 puppet gets disabled on mw hosts, preventing a wider outage
* 11:46 The patch gets reverted and merged: <nowiki>https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/puppet/+/797222</nowiki>
* 11:47 A manual puppet run is forced on eqiad
* 11:47 Multiple alerts arrive to IRC
* 11:49 the revert doesn’t fix things and a manual cumin run is needed
* 11:50  Incident opened.  <Manuel Arostegui> becomes IC.
* [11:50:46] <_joe_> jbond: it seems it tries to listen on port 443
* [11:51:16] <taavi> jbond: your patch makes apache2 listen on 443 regardless whether mod_ssl is enabled
* 11:56: The following command is issued across the fleet:  sudo cumin -m async 'mw1396*' 'sed -i"" "s/Listen 443//" /etc/apache2/ports.conf '  'systemctl start apache2 ' 
* 11:57: First recoveries arrive
* 11:58 MW app servers fixed here
* 12:05 The following patch is merged https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/puppet/+/798631/ to get the proper fix in place for other non-mw servers relying on existing default debian configuration
* 12:07 <_joe_> I am running puppet on people1003 (to test patch) - <_joe_> the change does the right thing there
* 12:16 Other non-mw apaches fixed here:  < jbond> sudo cumin C:httpd 'systemctl status apache2.service &>/dev/null' is all good

==Detection==

* The first detection was by the engineer who merged the patch.
* Later IRC alerts and pager.

==Conclusions==
During the Incident Review ritual, it was pointed out that if we had a way to deploy those changes in a controlled environment (e.g. canary) we could have been saved from this one. It was also noted that PCC did not catch this one as puppet complied this fine, it's just the resulting Apache configuration was unconditionally also listening on port 443.

===What went well?===
*The cause was quickly identified even before the alerts appeared
*''cumin'' let us ran a command quickly across the fleet

===What went poorly?===
*A careful review of the patch should've been done
*We don't have an environment to do a deployment of puppet changes in a controlled environment.

===Where did we get lucky?===
*Quickly identified the issue and the solution was clear.

===How many people were involved in the remediation?===
*3 SREs
*1 Volunteer
*1 IC
