== Summary ==


https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/mediawiki-config/+/923650 was accidentally +2'd without intent to deploy (like on a software repo rather than a config repo). This could have led to confusion for a future deployer.



==Timeline==
All times in UTC.

*05-30 10:00 https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/mediawiki-config/+/923650 is +2'd
*05-30 10:01 patch was reverted by an observer.

==Detection==

==Conclusions ==

OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)

===What went well?===

* The mistake was noticed by someone else within a minute, and subsequently reverted.

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc

===What went poorly?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc

===Where did we get lucky?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc

==Links to relevant documentation==

* …

Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.

==Actionables==

* …

Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.

Add the #Sustainability (Incident Followup) and the #SRE-OnFire  Phabricator tag to these tasks.
