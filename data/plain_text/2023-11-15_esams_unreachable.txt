== Summary ==


ESAMS DC was unreachable by users. Globally, we experienced a request drop from ~150k req/s to ~91k req/s as outlined in the Grafana dashboard. Users that were trying to reach Amsterdam DC experienced network errors and delays.

The incident doc still mentioned "We’re still investigating why some Grafana panels shows ~1hr of requests drop instead of ~10m (the actual incident duration)"

* 14:03 <XioNoX> !log reboot fpc0 on cr1-esams - T346779 (SAL)
* 14:04 <XioNoX> I restarted the linecard on the wrong router… Outage starts
* 14:05 Start receiving alerts, e.g. <+icinga-wm> PROBLEM - Host ncredir3003 is DOWN: PING CRITICAL - Packet loss
* 14:06 <vgutierrez> let's depool esams?
* 14:07 <jynus> vgutierrez: it is recovering now
* 14:07 <XioNoX> looks like it's back faster than a depool is needed
* 14:08 <vgutierrez> I can't reach text-lb.esams.wikimedia.org from here FWIW
* 14:08 depool esams https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/dns/+/974537/
* 14:08 DEPOOL FAILED due to authends-update issues
* 14:09 <+icinga-wm> started to see recoveries RECOVERY

* 14:09 <sukhe> we need to fix this to fix authdns-update
* 14:10 <topranks> let's just merge https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/dns/+/974534

* 14:11 <jynus> NEL is still high
* 14:16 marostegui updates the status page
* 14:17 <jynus> http traffic volume is still elevated, though
* 14:18 <jynus> others parameters look back to normal, including NEL timeouts
* 14:21 <+jinxer-wm> (NELHigh) resolved: (2) Elevated Network Error Logging events Outage ends
* 14:25 Updated status page to monitoring
* 14:26 Incident opened; fabfur becomes IC.

==Detection==
The outage was detected by an SRE shortly after an accidental change. Fired alerts confirmed the outage as well:


<+icinga-wm> PROBLEM - Host ncredir3003 is DOWN: PING CRITICAL - Packet loss


Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? Was the alert volume manageable? Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible?

==Conclusions ==

OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)

===What went well?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc

===What went poorly?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc

===Where did we get lucky?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc

==Links to relevant documentation==

* Depooling servers

==Actionables==

* …

Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.

Add the #Sustainability (Incident Followup) and the #SRE-OnFire  Phabricator tag to these tasks.
