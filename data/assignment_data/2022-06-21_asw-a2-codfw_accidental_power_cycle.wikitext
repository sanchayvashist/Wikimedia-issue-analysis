| impact = For 11 minutes, one of the Codfw server racks lost network connectivity. Among the affected servers was an LVS host. Another LVS host in Codfw automatically took over its load balancing responsibility for wiki traffic. During the transition, there was a brief increase in latency for regions served by Codfw (Mexico, and parts of US/Canada).

[[File:Screenshot 20220621 185358.png|thumb|right|Codfw app servers suffered increased latency during the incident. The latencies affected only internal monitoring (health checks) because Codfw was not serving application traffic at this time.|320x320px]]During regular maintenance, there was a (scheduled) loss of power redundancy on the codfw-A1 server rack around 14:32:00 UTC.

While the servers in this rack did not lose power (given a redundant power supply), they ''did'' fully lose network connectivity and thus effectively went down. This happened because the second power cable for the ASW network switch was not plugged all the way in, resulting in an unscheduled full loss of the switch for that rack, and hence the rack's network connectivity.

Happily, higher-level service redundancy worked as expected:
* regarding [[LVS]], lvs2010 automatically took over from lvs2007, for CDN traffic to [[Codfw data center|Codfw]]. There was a very temporary increase on response latency for on-the-fly Codfw requests until traffic stabilized.
* ns1 [[DNS]] server was automatically moved to Eqiad, should not have any user impact.
* Most A2 servers alerted about loss of power redundancy, but having 2 power supplies they didn't go down.
* App servers could have been affected more, latency-wise while they were automatically depooled, but they were not serving production traffic at this time as [[Eqiad data center|Eqiad]] is the primary DC.

After the secondary power cord was properly connected, connectivity recovered with no issues. Maintenance finished at 15:01.
