==Summary==

For approximately 12 minutes some internal services (e.g. Bacula and Etherpad) were not available or operated at reduced capacity. This was caused by a faulty memory stick leading to a reboot of db1128, which was at the time the primary host of the m1 database section.

==Actionables==
*Failover m1 primary db from db1128 to db1164
*db1128 faulty memory
