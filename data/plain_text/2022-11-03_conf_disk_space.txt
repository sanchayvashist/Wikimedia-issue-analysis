== Summary ==


A bug introduced to the MediaWiki codebase caused an increase in connections to Confd hosts from systems responsible for Dumps which in turn lead to a high volume of log events and ultimately a filled up filesystem.



==Timeline==
All times in UTC.

*2022-09-06: A bug is introduced on MediaWiki core codebase on 5b0b54599bfd, causing configuration to be checked for every row of a database query on WikiExport.php, but the feature is not yet enabled.
*2022-10-24: The feature is enabled: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/mediawiki-config/+/848201
*2022-11-03 08:09 Systemd timer starts dump process on snapshot10[10,13,12,11] that starts accessing dbctl/etcd (on conf1* hosts) once per row from a database query result.
*17:06 OUTAGE BEGINS conf1008 icinga alert: <icinga-wm> PROBLEM - Disk space on conf1008 is CRITICAL: DISK CRITICAL - free space: / 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): /tmp 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): /var/tmp 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Monitoring/Disk_space
*17:10 Incident opened, elukey notifies of conf1008 root partition almost full
*17:13 Disk space is freed with apt-get clean
*17:37 Some nodes reach 100% disk usage
*17:37 nginx logs are truncated
*17:39 etcd_access.log.1 are truncated in the 3 conf100* nodes
*17:39 OUTAGE ENDS: Disk space is under control
*17:46 DB maintenance is stopped
*17:48 denisse becomes IC
*17:50 All pooling/depooling of databases is stopped
*17:52 The origin of the issue is identified as excessive connections from snapshot[10,13,12,11]
*17:58 snapshot hosts stopped hammering etcd after pausing dumps
*18:15 Code change of fix merged https://sal.toolforge.org/log/4iLgPoQBa_6PSCT93YhE




==Detection==
The last symptom of his issue was detected by an Icinga alert: conf1008 icinga alert: <icinga-wm> PROBLEM - Disk space on conf1008 is CRITICAL: DISK CRITICAL - free space: / 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): /tmp 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): /var/tmp 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Monitoring/Disk_space

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* confd/etcd designed to not be a SPOF prevented further bad things from happening

===What went poorly?===

* We could have reacted to disk space warnings already instead of criticals
* There where several other metrics clearly pointing out that "something is off" (see linked graphs)

===Where did we get lucky?===

* People where around to react to the disk space critical alert

==Links to relevant documentation==

* Task that introduced the source of this issue: MW scripts should reload the database config; 

==Actionables==

* conf* hosts ran out of disk space due to log spam; 
* Monitor high load on etcd/conf* hosts to prevent incidents of software requiring config reload too often;
