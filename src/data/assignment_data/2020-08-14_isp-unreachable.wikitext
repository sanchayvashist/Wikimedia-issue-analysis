== Summary ==
Users of Jio ISP (India, AS 55836) unable to reach Wikimedia sites.

Caused by a misconfiguration in Jio's own RPKI records, which can only be fixed on their end.  Their network engineers are aware and working on the issue.

As temporary workaround, Wikimedia changed its network advertisements to accept invalid RPKI to let Jio costumers reach our sites again.
