==Summary==


Network connectivity for the A4 codfw server rack went down due to full power loss of its switch. This caused lots of alert spam, but otherwise it had very little to no impact on users due to services not being pooled on codfw or redundancy working as intended.

This was very similar incident to Incidents/2022-06-21 asw-a2-codfw accidental power cycle (bump wrong cable on switch side again). See that page for more details.

After the secondary power cord was properly connected, connectivity recovered with no known issues. Power maintenance on that rack finished at 15:50.
