== Summary ==


eqiad's Logstash experienced message congestion that exhausted the latency budget. This incident consumed 160% of the quarterly budget for delayed messages.



==Timeline==
Write a step by step outline of what happened to cause the incident, and how it was remedied.  Include the lead-up to the incident, and any epilogue.

Consider including a graphs of the error rate or other surrogate.

All times in UTC.

*TODO: Triggering event for the Parsoid errors.
*10:41 Beginning of a flood of exceptions logged from Parsoid, with message: [92ed9dea-d7d4-4b36-9398-202a2e4ccb4c] /w/rest.php/www.mediawiki.org/v3/page/pagebundle/Extension%3ATemplateStylesExtender/5769267   PHP Notice: Trying to get property 'nextSibling' of non-object (logstash)
*10:44 As events accumulate on the Kafka queue faster than Logstash can consume them, the fraction of events affected by consumer lag (measured by Burrow) rises from its normal value of zero. (dashboard) OUTAGE BEGINS
*10:45 Alert fires: (LogstashKafkaConsumerLag) firing: Too many messages in kafka logging (IRC)
*10:49 Exception logging hits its peak: 54.6k messages/sec.
*10:54 Last exception is logged from Parsoid. In total, 8,643,149 messages were logged. Logstash continues to work through the queue. (logstash)
*10:58 Kafka lag hits its peak: 45.8% of messages are lagged. (dashboard)
*12:55 Alert resolves: (LogstashKafkaConsumerLag) resolved: Too many messages in kafka logging (IRC)
*12:56 The last backlogged Parsoid events are processed, and the fraction of lagged events returns to zero. (dashboard) OUTAGE ENDS

==Detection==
One IRC-only alert fired:
 [10:45:55] <jinxer-wm> (LogstashKafkaConsumerLag) firing: Too many messages in kafka logging - https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Logstash#Kafka_consumer_lag - https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000484/kafka-consumer-lag?var-cluster=logging-eqiad&var-datasource=eqiad%20prometheus/ops - https://alerts.wikimedia.org/?q=alertname%3DLogstashKafkaConsumerLag
It was Saturday, and there was no page, so nobody saw or responded to the alert. The problem wasn't noticed until the end of the SLO quarter, when we discovered in the normal reporting process that Logstash had missed its latency SLO in eqiad.

==Conclusions ==

OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)

===What went well?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc

===What went poorly?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc

===Where did we get lucky?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc

== Links to relevant documentation ==

*Logstash#Kafka consumer lag
*...

Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.

==Actionables==

* TODO: Decide whether to include an action item for a paging alert on Kafka lag/backlog
* ...

Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.

Add the #Sustainability (Incident Followup) and the #SRE-OnFIRE (Pending Review & Scorecard)  Phabricator tag to these tasks.

                                              	Question                                                                                                          	Answer
(yes/no)	Notes
People                                        	Were the people responding to this incident sufficiently different than the previous five incidents?              	yes    	No one was paged or responded at the time of the incident. These answers are a best effort for that situation, based on the intent of the questions. (E.g., here, "yes" because the incident didn't contribute to burning anyone out.)
People                                        	Were the people who responded prepared enough to respond effectively                                              	no     	
People                                        	Were fewer than five people paged?                                                                                	yes    	
People                                        	Were pages routed to the correct sub-team(s)?                                                                     	no     	
People                                        	Were pages routed to online (business hours) engineers?  Answer “no” if engineers were paged after business hours.	yes    	
Process                                       	Was the "Incident status" section atop the Google Doc kept up-to-date during the incident?                        	no     	
Process                                       	Was a public wikimediastatus.net entry created?                                                                   	no     	But one wouldn't have been appropriate, even if we had responded -- Logstash is critical SRE-facing infrastructure but is not user-facing.
Process                                       	Is there a phabricator task for the incident?                                                                     	yes    	
Process                                       	Are the documented action items assigned?                                                                         	not yet	
Process                                       	Is this incident sufficiently different from earlier incidents so as not to be a repeat occurrence?               	yes    	
Tooling                                       	To the best of your knowledge was the open task queue free of any tasks that would have prevented this incident? Answer “no” if there are
open tasks that would prevent this incident or make mitigation easier if implemented.	yes    	
Tooling                                       	Were the people responding able to communicate effectively during the incident with the existing tooling?         	yes    	
Tooling                                       	Did existing monitoring notify the initial responders?                                                            	no     	
Tooling                                       	Were the engineering tools that were to be used during the incident, available and in service?                    	?      	Blank for now because I'm not sure. Logstash itself would have been a key debugging tool, and mid-incident it would have shown the culprit messages but at a long delay; between 10:54 and 12:55, we wouldn't have known that the flood was over. But maybe other tools would have had that information available.
Tooling                                       	Were the steps taken to mitigate guided by an existing runbook?                                                   	no
