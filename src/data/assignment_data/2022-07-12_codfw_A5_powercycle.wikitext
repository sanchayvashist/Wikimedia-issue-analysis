}}During the scheduled maintenance to upgrade the PDUs in rack A5, CyrusOne flipped the incorrect breaker on the breaker panel, prior to pulling the PDU's power cord out from its circuit.  This resulted in all servers in rack A5 losing power to both its primary and secondary power feeds.  The affected hardware in rack A5 booted back up, once CyrusOne realized the mistake and flipped the breaker back on.

== Actionable ==

* As a remediation item, the remaining PDU maintenances at codfw will no longer be hot-swapped with live equipment.  After 3 of 5 inadvertent incidents, Dc-Ops team deemed it would be safer to coordinate with the SREs for hard downtime for all the affected servers in each rack.  This would result in the graceful shutdown of affected servers, and allow for a shorter duration to complete each PDU upgrade with a temporary hired contractor.
