==Summary==


After a code change   rolled out in this week's train, the GlobalUsersPager class (part of CentralAuth) produced expensive DB queries that exhausted resources on s7 database replicas.

Backpressure from the databases tied up PHP-FPM workers on the API servers, triggering a paging alert for worker saturation. The slow queries were identified and manually killed on the database, which resolved the incident.

Because the alert fired and the queries were killed before available workers were fully exhausted, the impact was limited to s7. Full worker saturation would have resulted in a complete API outage.

Because only two engineers responded to the page and the response only took half an hour, we decided not to designate an incident coordinator, start a status doc, and so on. We didn't need those tools to organize the response, and they would have taken time away from solving the problem.

Documentation:
* Phabricator task detailing the slow query
* API server RED dashboard showing elevated latency and errors; php-fpm workers peaking around 75% saturation; and s7 database errors
* Same dashboard for the app servers showing measurable but lesser impact

==Actionables==

* Revert the patches generating the slow queries - done  
* Later (2022-04-06) it was discovered the query killer was using the old 'wikiuser' name, which prevented it from acting. Fixed in , deploying soon.
