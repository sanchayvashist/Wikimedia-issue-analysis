==Summary==


* At Tue May 31 17:09:10 UTC 2022 analytics-alerts@wikimedia.org received an email alert: "At least one Hadoop HDFS NameNode is active is CRITICAL"
* Otto, Btullis, Joal, and Mforns jumped in hangout to troubleshoot.
* /var/lib/hadoop/journal on all 5 journalnodes was full
* Otto and Btullis stopped namenodes and journalnodes
* Btullis increases /var/lib/hadoop/journal on journalnodes from 10 GB to 30 GB
* Btullis starts journalnodes, then master namenode.
* Otto forces HDFS to stay in safe mode.
* Wait for master namenode to apply edits from journalnodes.
* Start standby namenode
* Wait for standby namenode to apply edits
* Otto allows HDFS to leave safe mode.

Cause analysis:

On Sunday evening May 22, /srv filled up on an-master1002. an-master1002 takes daily fs image snapshots, and saves them in /srv/backup/hadoop/namenode, keeping the last 20.  Over time, as the number of HDFS blocks has increased, so has the size of these backup images.  

We received an alert email for a failure of the hadoop-namenode-backup-fetchimage that takes these backups with the subject "an-master1002/Check unit status of hadoop-namenode-backup-fetchimage is CRITICAL".

24 hours later, this backup job succeeded, even if no new image backup was taken, and we got a RECOVERY status email for this job.  Otto was on ops week, and only working half days this week.  Otto most likely saw the RECOVERY email and ignored the alert.

On Tuesday May 31, /var/lib/hadoop/journal on all journalnodes completely filled, and NameNodes crashed as they were not able to get ACKs from the journalnodes that their writes had been saved.

We believe that after /srv/backup/hadoop/namenode filled up on May 22, the standby NameNode was no longer able to save its image to /srv/hadoop/name/current.  Because no new image was saved, the hadoop-namenode-backup-fetchimage did not detect that a new image was present, it did not try to take a new backup.  The hadoop-namenode-backup-prune kept purning backup files older than 20 days, freeing up space on the /srv partition.  

However, because the standby NameNode was not able to save its FS images snapshots, JournalNodes were not able to clear up historical edits files, which caused them to fill up their journal partitions.

After the NameNodes were recovered and out of safe mode, writes could proceed.  All ingestion is handled either via Kafka or periodic jobs, and these can resume from where they left off.  No lasting impact.

==Actionables==

The following ticket contains all actionable items. https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T309649

These are:

* Make old journalnode edits files are cleaned properly now that namenodes are back online and saving fs image snapshots.
* Reduce profile::hadoop::backup::namenode::fsimage_retention_days, 20 is too many
* Create an alert for the freshness of the standby namenode's FSImage dump in /srv/hadoop/name/current
* Make sure journalnodes alert sooner about disk journalnode partition
* Check that bacula backups of fs image snapshots are available and usable
* Check that the alerting for disk space is correct on an-master hosts - since we seem not to have been alerted to /srv/ becoming full on an-master1002

All have now been completed.
