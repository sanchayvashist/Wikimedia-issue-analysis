== Summary ==


…

Log aggregation was failing on recently re-imaged Hadoop worker nodes. This was due to having the wrong value for the compression type to be used by the log aggregator service. This was spotted when some specific Airflow tasks were failing randomly when Airflow tried to fetch the aggregated logs. These were non-idempotent Airflow tasks (eg rm a tmp dir, or mv an previously created archive on HDFS). The Yarn applications were in a SUCCESS state, but the Airflow process failed to retrieve the logs and marked some of the task attempts as failed. This was fixed by correcting the compression type to gz from the erroneously submitted value of gzip.

Write how the issue was first detected.  Was automated monitoring first to detect it? Or a human reporting an error?

Copy the relevant alerts that fired in this section.

Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? Was the alert volume manageable? Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible?

TODO: If human only, an actionable should probably be to "add alerting".

==Conclusions ==

OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)

* We need to test config changes on the Hadoop test cluster first before merging.
* We need to remember to restart the services after a verified config change commit

===What went well?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc

===What went poorly?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc

===Where did we get lucky?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc

==Links to relevant documentation==

* …

Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.

==Actionables==

* Define an alert if the yarn config file modification time is newer than the service start time by more than 24 hours
** Apply this new alert pattern to other (HDFS, Namenode etc)

Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.

Add the #Sustainability (Incident Followup) and the #SRE-OnFire  Phabricator tag to these tasks.
