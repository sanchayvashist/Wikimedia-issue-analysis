<!-- Reminder: No private information on this page! -->

Parts of <code>/srv/deployment</code> were lost on active [[deployment server]] (deploy1002) due to the wrong command, <code>rm -rf</code>, being executed. This halted deployments for some time, until we were able to restore the directory from a backup and we checked it for correctness.
