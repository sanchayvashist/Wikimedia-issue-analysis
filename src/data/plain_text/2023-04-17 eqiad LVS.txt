== Summary ==


…

During scap deploys one of the LVS servers in eqiad was taken down which resulted in multiple servers being depooled making eqiad unable so serve traffic.



==Timeline==
All times in UTC.

*Scap runs at 13:52, 14:08, 14:10
*14:04 PyBal disabled on lvs1019 as part of maintenance but a deploy was ongoing OUTAGE BEGINS
*14:05 PROBLEM - PyBal backends health check on lvs1019 is CRITICAL: PYBAL CRITICAL - Bad Response from pybal: 500 Cant connect to localhost:9090 (Connection refused) https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/PyBal
*14:08 <icinga-wm> PROBLEM - PyBal backends health check on lvs1020 is CRITICAL: PYBAL CRITICAL - CRITICAL - appservers-https_443: Servers mw1418.eqiad.wmnet, mw1417.eqiad.wmnet, mw1416.eqiad.wmnet, mw1415.eqiad.wmnet, mw1414.eqiad.wmnet are marked down but pooled: parsoid-php_443: Servers parse1017.eqiad.wmnet, parse1011.eqiad.wmnet are marked down but pooled: api-https_443: Servers mw1447.eqiad.wmnet, mw1448.eqiad.wmnet, mw1449.eqiad.wmnet, mw1450.eqiad.wmnet  marked down but pooled https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/PyBal
*14:09: PyBal re-started on lvs1019
*14:14 bblack started repooling parsoid in
*14:17  Incident opened.  Janis becomes IC.
*14:21 appservers and api_appservers repooled
*14:22 jobrunners and videoscalers repooled
*14:25 recoveries coming in OUTAGE ENDS
*14:42 still elevated latencies on api_appservers, might be unrelated as there is a spike of read traffic on s7
*14:58 s7 query throughput is high due to db maintenance, most likely unrelated
*14:58 api_appserver latency trending down
*15:08] <jinxer-wm> (MediaWikiLatencyExceeded) resolved: Average latency high: ...


==Detection==
The issue was detected immediately by SRE doing maintenance work. Multiple alerts as well as pages immediately followed.

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* Automated alerting detected the issue quickly

===What went poorly?===

*We did not manage to avoid this happening again although we already knew about LVS downtime during scap deploys being an issue

===Where did we get lucky?===

* Remediation of the outage was quick due to its root cause already being known, see Incidents/2023-04-17 eqiad/LVS
