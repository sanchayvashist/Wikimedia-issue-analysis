A schema change ([[phab:T307501]]) made mariadb's optimizer change its query plan and made a very frequent query to globalblocks table on centralauth database (s7) to take 5 seconds instead of less than a second.

*05:45 Ongoing schema changes are stopped by Amir. Issue is narrowed down to s7 section queries.
*05:45 marostegui mentions https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/GlobalBlocking/+/785376/1/sql/mysql/patch-globalblocks-timestamps.sql#7  suggesting it as the cause.

* User reported it on IRC

==Conclusions==
===What went well?===
*The root cause was quickly identified and the revert was easy and fast to apply.

===What went poorly?===
*By pure bad luck an easy schema change resulted on the optimizer changing its behaviour
*Not many people showed up despite of being paged and this being a full outage

===Where did we get lucky?===
*The revert was easy and fast to apply as the table is quite small

===How many people were involved in the remediation?===
*2 DBAs and 1 SRE

==Links to relevant documentation==

* https://www.wikimediastatus.net/incidents/xzmd6vwvvgmx
* How to deploy a schema change: [[Schema changes]]
* There is no documentation on how to revert a schema change, as it is basically running the reverse command to leave the table as it was before.
