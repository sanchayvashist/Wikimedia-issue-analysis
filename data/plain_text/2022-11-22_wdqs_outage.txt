== Summary ==


…

For at least 15 minutes, users of the Wikidata Query Service either could not connect or received extremely slow responses.

==Timeline==
15:15 UTC 

* Pybal alert for all public wdqs hosts in eqiad datacenter. This pages on-duty SREs akosiaris, jelto and herron.
* Increased 5xx error rates
* Increased load avg-15 for all public wdqs hosts ( > 40 generally indicates user impact)

*15:16 dcausse, gehel and inflatador (Search Platform team and owners of the WDQS service) begin troubleshooting
*15:22 inflatador begins restarting all public wdqs hosts in eqiad datacenter. Alerts begin to clear. At this point, we presume the impact to users is over.
*15:34 inflatador finishes all restarts.
*16:11 (as I write this) load avg-15 remains at reasonable levels and we consider the service to be stabilized.

==Detection==
The issue was detected by monitoring (pybal alerts)

Example alert verbiage: PROBLEM - PyBal backends health check on lvs1020 is CRITICAL: PYBAL CRITICAL - CRITICAL - wdqs-heavy-queries_8888: Servers wdqs1015.eqiad.wmnet, wdqs1012.eqiad.wmnet, wdqs1004.eqiad.wmnet, wdqs1014.eqiad.wmnet, wdqs1016.eqiad.wmnet, wdqs1007.eqiad.wmnet, 

The appropriate alerts fired, and contained enough actionable information for humans to quickly remediate the problem.

==Conclusions ==
Search team has been aware of the brittle nature of WDQS for some time, and there are ongoing efforts to migrate off its current technology stack (specifically Blazegraph). We are also in the process of defining an SLO for WDQS.

===What went well?===

The appropriate alerts fired, and contained enough actionable information for humans to quickly remediate the problem.

=== What went poorly? ===

We're still investigating, but we believe one bad query caused this outage. A single user or query should not be able to take out an entire datacenter.

===Where did we get lucky?===

* We were able to remediate once. Theoretically, the user could keep sending the bad query over and over again, causing the same effect for end-users.
