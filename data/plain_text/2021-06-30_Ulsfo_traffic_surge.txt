 
==Summary==
Sometime after 22:00 UTC, a traffic surge started to fill up the capacity of a network port in the Ulsfo cluster. By 23:00 UTC the issue was mitigated.

Impact: For up to an hour, a portion of requests may have received a slower response from regions served by the San Francisco DC. This includes New Zealand, and parts of North America.
