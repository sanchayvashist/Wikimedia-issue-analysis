== Summary ==



Connecting a new server to our eqsin top of rack switches triggered a Juniper bug  which caused one of its processes to be killed and interrupting traffic transiting through the switch. This event caused also a Virtual-Chassis master switchover extending the outage. The process got automatically re-started and the situation stabilized by itself in about 5min.



==Timeline==
Write a step by step outline of what happened to cause the incident, and how it was remedied.  Include the lead-up to the incident, and any epilogue.

Consider including a graphs of the error rate or other surrogate.

All times in UTC.

*04:51 (TODO) OUTAGE BEGINS
*00:04 (Something something)
*00:06 (Voila) OUTAGE ENDS
*00:15 (post-outage cleanup finished)


TODO: Clearly indicate when the user-visible outage began and ended.

==Detection==
Write how the issue was first detected.  Was automated monitoring first to detect it? Or a human reporting an error?

Copy the relevant alerts that fired in this section.

Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? Was the alert volume manageable? Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible?

TODO: If human only, an actionable should probably be to "add alerting".

==Conclusions ==

OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)

===What went well?===

* The situation stabilized by itself
* Juniper was able to match the crash to a known bug (even though our code version is not supposed to be vulnerable to this bug)
* automated monitoring detected the incident

===What went poorly?===

* Nobody was paged despite the outage to be user impacting to be verified
* Nobody present during the outage opened a task documenting what happened
* Such improbable bug

===Where did we get lucky?===

==Actionables==

* Upgrade POPs asw to Junos 21 - https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T316532
* We're phasing out virtual chassis in the new POP network designs (cf. drmrs). Even though such bugs might always be a possibility, the new design is more resilient (each switch is independent)
