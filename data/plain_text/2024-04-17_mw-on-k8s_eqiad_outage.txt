== Summary ==


mcrouter daemonset on mw-on-k8s: The mediawiki pod has 9 containers. We were working on reducting this number to 7, by introducing the mw-mcrouter service. In practice, our end goal was that each mw-on-k8s pod would use a standalone mcrouter pod running within the same node, instead of its own mcrouter container. From mediawiki's POV, mcrouter's location would be mcrouter-main.mw-mcrouter.svc.cluster.local:4442 instead of 127.0.0.1:11213. The same change was deployed on codfw the day before, but codfw has less traffic. 

This change increased the number of DNS requests towards CoreDNS, from an average of 40k req/s to 110k req/s, overwhelming the pods.

==== Status at ~09:20 UTC: ====
* scap was blocked waiting for the deployment of mw-on-k8s to finish
* during the deployment, the mediawiki pods were never becoming ready, and after a while scap attampted to rollback
* CoreDNS pods (3) were overwhelmed and oom killed over and over again (being left in an crashloopbackoff state)

==== Actions: ====
* depooled mediawiki reads from eqiad (via discovery)
* Increase memory limits and replicas for coredns on wikikube clusters
* terminate mw-server FQDN with a dot - mcrouter-main.mw-mcrouter.svc.cluster.local.:4442 
* reverted eqiad to use in-pod mcrouter container
* pooled eqiad back

==Detection==
Antoine noticed an elevated number of events coming from the mediawiki channel on logstash. A few minutes later we got our first alert that we are running out of available php workers. 

==Conclusions ==


===What went well?===

* Everyone in ServiceOps was around
* Janis quickly figured out that we were missing the final dot in the FQDN

===What went poorly?===

* While we deployed the very same change on codfw the day before, we didn't properly analyse the impact. 

===Where did we get lucky?===

* No luck.
