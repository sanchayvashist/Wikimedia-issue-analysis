A bug introduced to the MediaWiki codebase caused an increase in connections to [[Confd]] hosts from systems responsible for [[Dumps]] which in turn lead to a high volume of log events and ultimately a filled up filesystem.

==Timeline==
''All times in UTC.''

*2022-09-06: A bug is introduced on MediaWiki core codebase on [[gerrit:c/mediawiki/core/+/798678|5b0b54599bfd]], causing configuration to be checked for every row of a database query on WikiExport.php, but the feature is not yet enabled.
*2022-10-24: The feature is enabled: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/mediawiki-config/+/848201
*2022-11-03 08:09 Systemd timer starts dump process on snapshot10[10,13,12,11] that starts accessing dbctl/etcd (on conf1* hosts) once per row from a database query result.
*17:06 '''OUTAGE BEGINS''' <code>conf1008 icinga alert: <icinga-wm> PROBLEM - Disk space on conf1008 is CRITICAL: DISK CRITICAL - free space: / 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): /tmp 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): /var/tmp 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): <nowiki>https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Monitoring/Disk_space</nowiki></code>
*17:10 Incident opened, elukey notifies of conf1008 root partition almost full
*17:13 Disk space is freed with <code>apt-get clean</code>
*17:37 Some nodes reach 100% disk usage
*17:37 nginx logs are truncated
*17:39 etcd_access.log.1 are truncated in the 3 conf100* nodes
*17:39 '''OUTAGE ENDS''': Disk space is under control
*17:46 DB maintenance is stopped
*17:48 denisse becomes IC
*17:50 All pooling/depooling of databases is stopped
*17:52 The origin of the issue is identified as excessive connections from <code>snapshot[10,13,12,11]</code>
*17:58 snapshot hosts stopped hammering etcd after pausing dumps
*18:15 Code change of fix merged https://sal.toolforge.org/log/4iLgPoQBa_6PSCT93YhE

==Detection==
The last symptom of his issue was detected by an Icinga alert: <code>conf1008 icinga alert: <icinga-wm> PROBLEM - Disk space on conf1008 is CRITICAL: DISK CRITICAL - free space: / 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): /tmp 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): /var/tmp 2744 MB (3% inode=98%): <nowiki>https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Monitoring/Disk_space</nowiki></code>

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* confd/etcd designed to not be a SPOF prevented further bad things from happening

===What went poorly?===

* We could have reacted to disk space warnings already instead of criticals
* There where several other metrics clearly pointing out that "something is off" (see linked graphs)

===Where did we get lucky?===

* People where around to react to the disk space critical alert

==Links to relevant documentation==

* Task that introduced the source of this issue: MW scripts should reload the database config; {{PhabT|T298485}}

==Actionables==

* conf* hosts ran out of disk space due to log spam; {{PhabT|T322360}}
* Monitor high load on etcd/conf* hosts to prevent incidents of software requiring config reload too often; {{PhabT|T322400}}

|No
|From the memory of review ritual participants we had that exact same issue before

|To the best of your knowledge was the open task queue free of any tasks that would have prevented this incident? ''Answer “no” if there are''
''open tasks that would prevent this incident or make mitigation easier if implemented.''
|Yes
|
|-
| Were the people responding able to communicate effectively during the incident with the existing tooling?
|Yes
|
|-
|Did existing monitoring notify the initial responders?
|Yes
|
|-
|Were the engineering tools that were to be used during the incident, available and in service? 
|Yes
