A large influx in requests led to excessive thread pool usage from codfw blazegraph backends, with concomitant increases in CPU load and throttling filter state size. This triggered a known bug in Blazegraph where its improper thread management leads to deadlock.

The system self healed, perhaps due to application-level throttling state throttling the offender.

Most or all CODFW-routed wdqs requests during the incident window failed.

==Detection==

The issue was rapidly detected by pybal monitoring of WDQS. A page was emitted by the monitoring system fairly quickly.

==Conclusions ==

<mark>OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)</mark>

===What went well?===

* …

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc</mark>

===What went poorly?===

* …

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc</mark>

===Where did we get lucky?===

* …

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc</mark>

==Links to relevant documentation==
