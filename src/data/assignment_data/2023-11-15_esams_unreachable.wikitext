ESAMS DC was unreachable by users. Globally, we experienced a request drop from ~150k req/s to ~91k req/s as outlined in the [https://grafana.wikimedia.org/goto/sSa9A5IIz Grafana dashboard]. Users that were trying to reach Amsterdam DC experienced network errors and delays.

<mark>The incident doc still mentioned "We’re still investigating why some Grafana panels shows ~1hr of requests drop instead of ~10m (the actual incident duration)"</mark>

* 14:03 <XioNoX> !log reboot fpc0 on cr1-esams - T346779 ([https://sal.toolforge.org/production?p=2&q=&d=2023-11-15 SAL])
* 14:04 <XioNoX> I restarted the linecard on the wrong router… '''Outage starts'''
* 14:05 Start receiving alerts, e.g. <+icinga-wm> PROBLEM - Host ncredir3003 is DOWN: PING CRITICAL - Packet loss
* 14:06 <vgutierrez> let's depool esams?
* 14:07 <jynus> vgutierrez: it is recovering now
* 14:07 <XioNoX> looks like it's back faster than a depool is needed
* 14:08 <vgutierrez> I can't reach text-lb.esams.wikimedia.org from here FWIW
* 14:08 depool esams https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/dns/+/974537/
* 14:08 DEPOOL FAILED due to authends-update issues
* 14:09 <+icinga-wm> started to see recoveries RECOVERY
* 14:09 <sukhe> /tmp/dns-check.rudydea2/zones/netbox/4.64.10.in-addr.arpa
* 14:09 <sukhe> we need to fix this to fix authdns-update
* 14:10 <topranks> let's just merge https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/dns/+/974534
* ??:?? <XioNoX> text-lb is reachable again
* 14:11 <jynus> NEL is still high
* 14:16 marostegui updates the status page
* 14:17 <jynus> http traffic volume is still elevated, though
* 14:18 <jynus> others parameters look back to normal, including NEL timeouts
* 14:21 <+jinxer-wm> (NELHigh) resolved: (2) Elevated Network Error Logging events '''Outage ends'''
* 14:25 Updated status page to monitoring
* 14:26 Incident opened; [[User:Fabfur|fabfur]] becomes IC.
* 14:35 Status page set to resolved

==Detection==
The outage was detected by an SRE shortly after an accidental change. Fired alerts confirmed the outage as well:

<code>
<+icinga-wm> PROBLEM - Host ncredir3003 is DOWN: PING CRITICAL - Packet loss
</code>

<mark>Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? Was the alert volume manageable? Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible?</mark>

==Conclusions ==

<mark>OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)</mark>

===What went well?===

* …

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc</mark>

===What went poorly?===

* …

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc</mark>

===Where did we get lucky?===

* …

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc</mark>

==Links to relevant documentation==

* [[Depooling servers]]

==Actionables==

* …

<mark>Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.</mark>

<mark>Add the [[phab:project/view/4758/|#Sustainability (Incident Followup)]] and the [[phab:project/profile/4626/|#SRE-OnFire]]  Phabricator tag to these tasks.</mark>
