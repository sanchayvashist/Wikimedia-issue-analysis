}}

An expensive query sent over and over again by an external user(s) caused errors and timeouts for users accessing the WDQS service from our CODFW datacenter. A requestctl rule was put in place to mitigate the issue.

''All times in UTC''

*1047 first Icinga alerts fire. Example verbiage: - ''PyBal backends health check on lvs2010 is CRITICAL: PYBAL CRITICAL - CRITICAL - wdqs-heavy-queries_8888: Servers wdqs2009.codfw.wmnet are marked down but pooled''
*1536 Rolling restart of the WDQS service in CODFW temporarily stabilizes the service
*1630 Time spent in old garbage collection (metric that closely correlates with the outage) starts to rise again (see graph).
*1821 Requestctl rule to mitigate abuse deployed, followed by a rolling restart of the WDQS service in CODFW.  Service starts to stabilize.
*1924 Old GC is back down to the levels of the non-affected datacenter (eqiad). Incident closed.

==Detection==
<mark>Write how the issue was first detected.  Was automated monitoring first to detect it? Or a human reporting an error</mark>

Detected by monitoring

<mark>Copy the relevant alerts that fired in this section.</mark>

See above for example.

<mark>Did the appropriate alert(s) fire?</mark> 

Yes

<mark>Was the alert volume manageable?</mark> 

Yes

<mark>Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible?</mark>

No. We saw increased 5xx errors and lots of time spent in old garbage collection, but it's still difficult to troubleshoot this type of abuse. 

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* Alerts fired promptly 
* Other SREs provided lots of help.

===What went poorly?===

* Finding the right query/abusive IP etc for WDQS takes a long time, and solutions are often incomplete due to the fragile nature of the service.

===Where did we get lucky?===

* SMEs for the service were at work when the alerts fired

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc</mark>

==Links to relevant documentation==

* …

<mark>Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.</mark>

==Actionables==

* …

<mark>Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.</mark>

<mark>Add the [[phab:project/view/4758/|#Sustainability (Incident Followup)]] and the [[phab:project/profile/4626/|#SRE-OnFire]]  Phabricator tag to these tasks.</mark>
