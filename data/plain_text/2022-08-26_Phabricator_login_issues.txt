== Summary ==



After testing https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/puppet/+/826785 in cp6016. ATS layer prevented Phabricator's (and theoretically, other services too, but it was less impacting) session cookies reaching the service's origin server. 474fb2d didn't work as expected because it hit an ATS bug/missdocumented feature. Cookie data was stored in ts.ctx during do_global_post_remap() and restored in do_global_cache_lookup_complete() but for some reason ts.ctx gets wiped in the middle of those two hooks. 474fb2d also missed the step now performed in hide_cookie_store_response().

After the change was reverted, login issues stopped and users were able to perform regular Phabricator logged-in actions.

* [10:47] Issue considered resolved. Followups to continue on ticket.

==Detection==

The issue was quickly pointed out by several people on IRC, in the SRE channel as it impacted highly visible ongoing work of several engineers and volunteers (dcaro, dhinus, jynus, claime).

No alerts where sent because it only affected logged-in users, while the site acted normally for anonymous users.

==Conclusions ==

This probably should be written by the service owner, but in my understanding, a new test was setup on production with an undetected bug, causing traffic disruption (cookie filtering). I don't know if there is much else to do as the same bug is unlikely to hit again; except maybe enabling some kind of automatic monitoring detection of a similar issue.

===What went well?===

* MediaWiki ("the wikis") was not affected
* It caused no long-term consequences (no user data lost, no permanent session lost)
* Many people communicated quickly and effectively the issue

===What went poorly?===

* There was no monitoring setup to detect the issue
* There was a long tail of checking if the issue was corrected after testing finished / it took a bit to understand the source

==Actionables==

* Improve monitoring to detect ability to log in/perform logged in actions on production Phabricator (?)
