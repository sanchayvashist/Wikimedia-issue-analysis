==Summary==



Starting on Sat 4 May 2022, incoming emails from Google Mail servers began being rejected with the log message "503 BDAT command used when CHUNKING not advertised". These errors were not noticed by us until five days later on Thu 9 May 2022. After some investigation, it was determined that disabling chunking support in Exim would mitigate the errors. During the time span of the incident about 14,000 emails were rejected with an SMTP 503 error code, the senders are naturally notified by their email provider about undelivered mail.

==Detection==
The issue was first detected by users sending emails, https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T307873. Though, the messages were rejected by Exim with a 503 error code. We do graph the number of bounced messages, but our alerting did not pick up these bounces, https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000451/mail?orgId=1&from=1651536000000&to=1652227199000

==Conclusions==
Email monitoring of bounced messages does not account for all bounces.

===What went well?===
*We had a good group of SREs jump on the problem when the severity of the incident was understood.

===What went poorly?===
*The severity of the issue was not understood until five days after we first started seeing errors

===Where did we get lucky?===
*Faidon jumped into help with his extensive Exim and email knowledge even though he is no longer in a technical SRE role.

===How many people were involved in the remediation?===
*4 SREs and 1 incident commander
