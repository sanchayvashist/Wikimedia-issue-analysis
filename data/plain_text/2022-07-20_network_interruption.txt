==Summary==


At 03:16, the top-of-rack switch asw2-c-eqiad virtual chassis lost connectivity to FPC5, partitioning the network. This caused a hard down event for all hosts in rack C5 (netbox). It also caused additional instability due to how the virtual chassis works, and because it's incorrectly cabled up.

We received a burst of both paging and non-paging alerts: Icinga reporting hosts down; BGP status; application-level errors; and MariaDB replica alerts. At least one user also reported via IRC that they couldn't access metawiki (almost certainly uncacheable traffic, due to logged-in state).

At 03:22, asw2-c-eqiad:fpc5 came back online. Most systems recovered automatically, but some needed manual attention:

* We received HAProxy failover alerts on dbproxy1018 through 1021, and those needed to be resolved by reloading haproxy manually, as expected.
* Phabricator's dbproxy had failed over to a read-only replica (as expected) but Phabricator was unavailable for read-only tasks in read-only mode. When users attempted to view a task, they got an error page saying, Unhandled Exception ("AphrontQuery Exception") #1290: The MariaDB server is running with the --read-only option so it cannot execute this statement This was resolved by reloading haproxy, but Phab was expected to be available for reads.
* The Kubernetes API server alerted for high latency until kube-apiserver was manually restarted on both hosts.

==Actionables==

*T313384 Recable eqiad row C switch fabric, so that in the future a failure like this will only impact servers in rack C5.
*T313382#8090176 Move critical hosts, like DB masters, away from rack C5 until its top-of-rack switch is trustworthy.
* T313382#8090224 Add LibreNMS alerting (and runbook) for this scenario, which will speed up troubleshooting.
*T313879 Make read-only Phabricator operations possible when its database is in read-only mode.
