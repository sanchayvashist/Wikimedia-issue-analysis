<!-- Reminder: No private information on this page! -->

There was an increase in requests to the API cluster that resulted in reduction of availabe PHP workers and a database host (db1132) running out of available connections. This database host runs MariaDB 10.6 which is known to be sensitive to high load. This resulted in an increase in latency and errors returned to clients. The spike auto-recovered and it's not clear what the exact root cause was.
