== Summary ==


An expensive query sent over and over again by an external user(s) caused errors and timeouts for users accessing the WDQS service from our CODFW datacenter. A requestctl rule was put in place to mitigate the issue.

All times in UTC

*1047 first Icinga alerts fire. Example verbiage: - PyBal backends health check on lvs2010 is CRITICAL: PYBAL CRITICAL - CRITICAL - wdqs-heavy-queries_8888: Servers wdqs2009.codfw.wmnet are marked down but pooled
*1536 Rolling restart of the WDQS service in CODFW temporarily stabilizes the service
*1630 Time spent in old garbage collection (metric that closely correlates with the outage) starts to rise again (see graph).
*1821 Requestctl rule to mitigate abuse deployed, followed by a rolling restart of the WDQS service in CODFW.  Service starts to stabilize.
*1924 Old GC is back down to the levels of the non-affected datacenter (eqiad). Incident closed.

==Detection==
Write how the issue was first detected.  Was automated monitoring first to detect it? Or a human reporting an error

Detected by monitoring

Copy the relevant alerts that fired in this section.

See above for example.

Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? 

Yes

Was the alert volume manageable? 

Yes

Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible?

No. We saw increased 5xx errors and lots of time spent in old garbage collection, but it's still difficult to troubleshoot this type of abuse. 

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* Alerts fired promptly 
* Other SREs provided lots of help.

===What went poorly?===

* Finding the right query/abusive IP etc for WDQS takes a long time, and solutions are often incomplete due to the fragile nature of the service.

===Where did we get lucky?===

* SMEs for the service were at work when the alerts fired

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc

==Links to relevant documentation==

* …

Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.

==Actionables==

* …

Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.

Add the #Sustainability (Incident Followup) and the #SRE-OnFire  Phabricator tag to these tasks.
