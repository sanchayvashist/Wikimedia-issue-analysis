== Summary ==
A change to the global k8s defaults was merged that made the next mediawiki on kubernetes deployment pick up a wrong certificate for TLS termination.

==Detection==
The issue was detected by a page:

 (ProbeDown) firing: (6) Service mw-api-ext:4447 has failed probes (http_mw-api-ext_ip4)
 (ProbeDown) firing: Service mw-api-int:4446 has failed probes (http_mw-api-int_ip4)

There was also secondary failures:

 [12:51] <jinxer-wm> (KubernetesAPILatency) resolved: (4) High Kubernetes API latency

 [12:02] <icinga-wm> PROBLEM - Check unit status of httpbb_kubernetes_mw-api-int_hourly on cumin2002 is CRITICAL

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* The root of the problem could be detected quickly because the person that issued the breaking change was a responder
*

===What went poorly?===

* The root cause should have been visible CI (unfortunately not in the CI of the repo the change was made in; hieradata vs. deployment-charts)

=== Where did we get lucky? ===

* Only 1% of traffic is routed to k8s currently, so there was only limited impact

==Links to relevant documentation==

* …

==Actionables==

* Because of the low traffic (relatively small amount of errors) it took some time to pin this to k8s- does that need some actionables, or will it resolve itself as k8s becomes the majority of requests?
* Review if some deployment procedures/testing should be strengthen (e.g. surprising changes on next deployment, canary deployment for k8s, etc)
* Some metrics become unavailable or unhealthy during deployment- could something be done about that (either for the metrics or mitigation of deployment impact)
* Should depooling k8s have been done earlier?
