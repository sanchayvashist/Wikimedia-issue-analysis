==Summary==


A Puppet patch (change 817307) was merged which would accidentally install confd on a significant number of production hosts. The Puppet provisioning for these confd installations failed half-way due to having no corresponding Icinga checks defined. This in turn fired an Icinga alert:
 10:44 <icinga-wm> PROBLEM - Widespread puppet agent failures on alert1001 is CRITICAL: 0.1057 ge 0.01 
Engineers started work on reversing it, by cleaning up the inadvertent installs of confd via Cumin. Security posture was not compromised and there was no external user impact.

==Actionables==

* Git defaults to shows the author's date, not the commit date. Consider adding the following aliases to your git config as fix:
** lola = log --graph --pretty=format:\"%C(auto)%h%d%Creset %C(cyan)(%cr)%Creset %C(green)%cn <%ce>%Creset %s\" --all
** grephist = log --graph --pretty=format:\"%C(auto)%h%d%Creset %C(cyan)(%cr)%Creset %C(green)%cn <%ce>%Creset %s\" --all -S
