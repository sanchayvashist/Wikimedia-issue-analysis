| impact = For 12 minutes, all wikis were unreachable for logged-in users and for anonymous users trying to edit or access uncached content. Two spikes: from 08:24 to 08:30 UTC, and from 08:39 to 08:45 UTC approximately.
}}
The root cause seems to have been db1099, a replica database in the [[s8]] section  (Wikidata), that was rebooted for maintenance shortly before the incident and it was slowly repooled into production while at the same time there was a file transfer over the network from the same host. The load caused by the repooling, although at a very small percentage of the traffic, in addition to the existing bandwidth used by the file transfer, the host became slow to respond to queries, but not enough to be considered down and depooled automatically by other systems. This caused a cascade effect on DBs on the same section (s8) which got overloaded, and, because practically every page render involve reads from s8, it had a secondary cascade effect on all wikis, causing the exhaustion of workers at the application layer. The user-facing side of the outage was seen as slow or unavailable access to uncached render pages or perform read-write actions.
