<!-- Reminder: No private information on this page! -->https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/mediawiki-config/+/923650 was accidentally +2'd without intent to deploy (like on a software repo rather than a config repo). This could have led to confusion for a future deployer.

==Conclusions ==

<mark>OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)</mark>

===What went well?===

* The mistake was noticed by someone else within a minute, and subsequently reverted.

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc</mark>

===What went poorly?===

* …

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc</mark>

===Where did we get lucky?===

* …

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc</mark>

==Links to relevant documentation==

* …

<mark>Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.</mark>

==Actionables==

* …

<mark>Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.</mark>

<mark>Add the [[phab:project/view/4758/|#Sustainability (Incident Followup)]] and the [[phab:project/profile/4626/|#SRE-OnFire]]  Phabricator tag to these tasks.</mark>
