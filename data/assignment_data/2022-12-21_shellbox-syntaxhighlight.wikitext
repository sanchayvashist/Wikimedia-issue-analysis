<!-- Reminder: No private information on this page! -->A sudden spike in requests to shellbox-syntaxhighlight overloaded the service leading to slow response times and increased failures.

The majority of requests where originating from jobrunners and api_appservers.

==Timeline==
''All times in UTC.''

*09:00 '''OUTAGE BEGINS''' non paging alerts of failing http-api probes and api_appservers running out of idle workers where observed in #mediawiki-operations; Investigation started
*09:03 paging alert: (ProbeDown) firing: Service shellbox-syntaxhighlight:4014 has failed probes (http_shellbox-syntaxhighlight_ip4)
*09:05 shellbox-syntaxhighlight req/s increased from ~5 to ~70req/s
*09:05 shellbox-syntaxhighlight scaled up from 12 to 40 replicas
*09:09 Alerts recovering
*09:10 '''OUTAGE ENDS'''
*09:11 (CirrusSearchJobQueueBacklogTooBig) firing: CirrusSearch job topic eqiad.mediawiki.job.cirrusSearchLinksUpdate is heavily backlogged with 209k messages
*09:49 cirrusSearchLinksUpdate backlog was cleared
*09:54 shellbox-syntaxhighlight scaled back to 12 replicas

<!-- Reminder: No private information on this page! -->==Detection==
[[File:Shellbox-syntaxhighlight grafana.png|thumb|shellbox-syntaxhighlight grafana dashboard]]
Initially detected by a human spotting alerts on IRC, closely followed by a page.

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* Problem spotted early and countermeasures where taken quickly
* [[File:Envoy telemetry dashboard.png|thumb|envoy telemetry dashboard]]One of the SREs paged knew how to increase the number of syntaxhighlight runners (it's not mentioned on [[Shellbox]])

===What went poorly?===

* shellbox-syntaxhighlight was probably overloaded by our own services (jobrunners), but currently this is an assumption.

===Where did we get lucky?===

* The burst in requests was rather short

==Links to relevant documentation==

* https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes/Deployments

==Actionables==

* Figure out what caused the burst (there's a suggestion a template was changed leading to a lot of pages needing re-rendering at once)
* Document how to scale up shellbox runners? (or link to it from [[Shellbox]])

''open tasks that would prevent this incident or make mitigation easier if implemented.''
|No
|While they might not have fully prevented this incident, there are (long) outstanding performance issues with syntaxhighlight: {{PhabT|T271751}}, {{PhabT|T316858}}
