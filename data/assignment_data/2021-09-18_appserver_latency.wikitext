==Summary==
Slow database queries resulted in php-fpm worker exhaustion.

'''Impact''': For about 10 minutes, backends were slow or unavailable for all wikis. This affected logged-in users, most bots/API queries, and some page views from unregistered users (pages that were recently edited or otherwise expired from the CDN cache). 

'''Documentation''':
