==Summary==

A particular banner was deployed via CentralNotice that was both enabled for all users and with 100% sampling rate for its event instrumentation.

This caused instabilities at the outer traffic layer. The large amount of incoming traffic for event beacons, each of which had to be handed off to a backend service (eventgate-analytics-external), resulted in connections piling up and Varnish was unable to handle it and other traffic as a result, thus causing wikis to be unreachable in the affected regions. Initially Esams datacenter clients (mostly Europe, Africa and Middle East), with some temporary issues on other datacenters (Eqiad) as well when we initially attempted to reroute traffic to there.



Documentation:
*Varnish traffic 08:00-12:00 (Grafana)
*Frontend traffic 2xx responses (Grafana)
*navtiming pageview sampling (Grafana)
*https://www.wikimediastatus.net/incidents/rhn1l6k33ynz
*Restricted documented

==Actionables==

*  Avoid flood of CN banner analytics
*  Set a maximum for configurable sample rate of CentralNotice events that use EventGate
