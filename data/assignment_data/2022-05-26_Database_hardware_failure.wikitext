}}
For approximately 12 minutes some internal services (e.g. [[Bacula]] and [[Etherpad]]) were not available or operated at reduced capacity. This was caused by a faulty memory stick leading to a reboot of db1128, which was at the time the primary host of the [[MariaDB#Miscellaneous|m1 database section]].
