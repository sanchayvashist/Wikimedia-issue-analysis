==Summary==


A firewall change was pushed to ulsfo routers, which caused ulsfo to lose connectivity to the other POPs and core sites for 3min.

== Timeline ==
* 16:03 - apply configuration change on cr3-ulsfo
* 16:05 - apply configuration change on cr4-ulsfo - outage starts
* 16:06 - Icinga notifies about connectivity issues to ulsfo - paging
* 16:08 - change rolled back - outage ends

Root cause:

The change incorrectly restricts BFD to BGP peers:
+      term allow_bfd {
+          from {
+              source-prefix-list {
+                  bgp-sessions;
+              }
+              protocol udp;
+              port 3784-3785;
+          }
+          then accept;
+      }
While BFD is also used by OSPF sessions, which caused them to be tear down.

One surprising point is that the issue didn't show up in the verification commands (show ospf interfaces, show ospf neighbors), all neighbors are present.
show ospf interface   

Interface           State   Area            DR ID           BDR ID          Nbrs

ae0.2               PtToPt  0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0            1

et-0/0/1.401        PtToPt  0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0            1

xe-0/1/1.0          PtToPt  0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0            1

show ospf neighbor    

Address          Interface              State     ID               Pri  Dead

198.35.26.197    ae0.2                  Full      198.35.26.193    128    35

198.35.26.199    et-0/0/1.401           Full      198.35.26.194    128    33

198.35.26.209    xe-0/1/1.0             Full      208.80.154.198   128    34
While it was effectively down:

rpd[16292]: RPD_OSPF_NBRDOWN: OSPF neighbor 198.35.26.209 (realm ospf-v2 xe-0/1/1.0 area 0.0.0.0) state changed from Full to Down due to InActiveTimer (event reason: BFD session timed out and neighbor was declared dead)

== Conclusion ==
* More progressive roll out (longer wait time between each routers, as well as fewer changes at a time) could have reduced the risk of the issue happening
* Monitoring properly caught the issue
