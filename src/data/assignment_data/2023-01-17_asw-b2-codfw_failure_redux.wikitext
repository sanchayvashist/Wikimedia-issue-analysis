Two main issues happened during this window:

# The prep work to bring online the replacement switch from the [[labsconsole:Incidents/2023-01-14_asw-b2-codfw_failure|prior incident]] triggered a Junos bug which brought instability in row B (mostly impacting connectivity between the different switches in row B)
# Another Junos bug (triggered by an operator error) broke IPv6 connectivity for the whole row

The first point was quickly fixed, while the 2nd required onsite work to minimize downtime as it required B2 to come back up to be able to reboot B7 (those two are the uplinks to the core routers).

''All times in UTC.''

* 12:49: #pages for hosts down in codfw
* 12:57: codfw frontend depooled  geoip/generic-map/codfw => DOWN
* 13:00  Incident opened. effie becomes IC.
* 13:01: conftool action : set/pooled=false; selector: dnsdisc=restbase-async,name=codfw
* 13:01 : conftool action : set/pooled=true; selector: dnsdisc=restbase-async,name=.*
* 13:12: Klaxxoned all SREs
* 13:13: START - Cookbook sre.discovery.service-route check citoid: maintenance
* 13:14: START - Cookbook sre.discovery.service-route depool mobileapps in codfw: maintenance
* 13:14: <Emperor> depool swift from codfw [ sudo confctl --object-type discovery select 'dnsdisc=swift,name=codfw' set/pooled=false] 
* 13:16: misconfiguration on router fixed, IPv4 works, IPv6 still not working
* 13:26 _joe_: depooling all services in codfw
* 13:27: jynus: restarting manually replication on es2020, may require data check afterwards
* 13:35: mvernon: conftool action : set/pooled=false; selector: dnsdisc=thanos-swift,name=codfw
* 13:35: mvernon: conftool action : set/pooled=false; selector: dnsdisc=thanos-query,name=codfw
* 13:37: jiji: conftool action : set/pooled=false; selector: dnsdisc=recommendation-api,name=codfw
* 13:40: claime: investigating unreachable etcds on ganeti host ganeti2020.codfw.wmnet
* 14:10: restart cassandra on aqs2005 (didn’t help)
* 14:39: topranks: I added a static ARP entry for the secondary IPv4 addresses belonging to restbase2013 on cr2-codfw and they are reachable again 
* 14:39: so the issue is similar to the IPv6 problem, in that the switch is not forwarding certain multicast/broadcasts (some ARP, all ICMPv6 ND)
* 15:26: XioNoX: we're going to bring B2 into the row B virtual chassis,
* 15:29: :XioNoX: rack B2 comming up, looks stable
* 15:42: claime: etcd clusters OK
* 16:20 inflatador becomes IC
* 16:59 effie:  !log pooling back depooled mw servers in codfw
* 17:07 bblack: confirmed that all B2 hosts seem to be on private1-b-codfw, and yeah all have the :118: issue (except the one I manually fixed)
* 17:16 bblack: │ trying the cumin run
* 17:17: bblack: [done]


==Detection==

* 12:49: LibreNMS alerts fired. Example verbiage: ''Alert for device asw-b-codfw.mgmt.codfw.wmnet - virtual-chassis crash''
* The issues were triggered by Netops work, so engineers were already looking and identified the bugs quickly

<mark>Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? Was the alert volume manageable? Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible?</mark>

Yes and yes

==Conclusions ==
===What went well?===

* Alerts helped pinpoint the root cause almost immediately
* The prep work was done in advance of scheduled onsite work
* Most services continued to work over IPv4 when IPv6 was not working

===What went poorly?===

*The eqiad and codfw Juniper virtual chassis are particularly sensitive to switch replacements
*Some of codfw switches are cabled differently from our standards, resulting in some virtual-chassis cables being already connected on the "to be configured" switch
*We hit two different bugs in the same window

===Where did we get lucky?===

* Incident happened during EU working hours
* Services were already depooled from Saturday's incident (some luck, but also good judgement from Saturday's responders)

==Links to relevant documentation==

==Actionables==

* Create a cookbook to properly depool (or switchover) all services from a datacenter [[phab:T327665|T327665]]
** Cookbook for rack depool - https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T327300
* Visually represent (grafana) where a service is being served from any given time (eqiad, codfw, or both), so we can return to the same state before the incident [[phab:T327663|T327663]]
* Data check es2020 {{phab|T327770}}
* Upgrade all of eqiad and codfw rows - https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T327248
* (longer term) Plan codfw row A/B top-of-rack switch refresh - https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T327938
