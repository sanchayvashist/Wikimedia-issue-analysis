==Summary==


The reason appears to be background parsing associated with VisualEditor. The MWExtensionDialog as used in Score has the default 0.25s debounce preview, meaning we're shelling out to Lilypond through Shellbox every quarter-second while the user is typing -- regardless of whether an existing shellout is in flight. That's reasonable for lots of parsing applications that take much less time than that, but for something as heavy as these score parses, we should extend that interval, which would have the effect of cutting down on the request rate to shellbox.

==Conclusions==
===What went well?===

*automated monitoring detected the incident
*Had a good amount of incident responders
===What went poorly?===

*We're missing X-IP (Original IP forwarded by proxy), no referrer from mobile apps, (UA: MobileApps/WMF)
*Issue was known but not yet addressed.

===Where did we get lucky?===

* No, incident would have resolved it self eventually. 

===How many people were involved in the remediation?===

* 4 SREs during incident
* 1 IC
* 2 SRE for actual fix
