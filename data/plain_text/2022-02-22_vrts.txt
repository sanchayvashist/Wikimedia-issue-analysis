==Summary==



A stuck vrts aliases generating process on mx2001 resulted in rejects for dcw@wikimedia.org, a new VRTS queue.

On 2022-02-02 an SRE with long-time knowledge about VRTS received an email to their individual work address from a known VRTS admin, stating that a newly created VRTS queue "dcw@wikimedia.org" returned errors to some users that tried to use it (but not always, e.g. manual testing worked fine). The errors were of type SMTP 550 Error and looked as follows:
 208.80.153.45 does not like recipient.
 Remote host said: 550 Previous (cached) callout verification failure
A few hours later (by 2022-02-22 13:29), an investigation independently verified that email would not always be reliably sent to this VRTS email queue and the issue was escalated to a couple of other knowledgeable SREs. Given the incoming path and the fact that the only failing email address was a relatively new one not yet in widespread use, the incident was implicitly triaged as low priority. By 14:35 UTC it was verified again, adding more data points and a first theory formulated that our Google work email system was at fault as emails from other MTAs were sent out successfully but sending from wikimedia.org domains failed. However, by 16:47 UTC, it became clear that the generate_otrs_aliases.service systemd timer job was stuck and was not updating VRTS mailing lists/queues on mx2001 while it was running fine on mx1001 (that discrepancy explains why it was sometimes reproducible). After restart of the systemd timer job, the issue was fixed and the fix communicated to the VRTS admin.

==Actionables==
*Figure out why generate_otrs_aliases.service was stuck.
*Alert on a stuck generate_otrs_aliases.service.
