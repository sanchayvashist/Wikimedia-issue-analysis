Outage begins

*2023-05-25 05:11: Icinga alert fires: <icinga-wm> PROBLEM - MariaDB Replica SQL: s1 on db1154 is CRITICAL, replication lag on db1154, db1155 and clouddb start to increase
*2023-05-25 05:11: Replication breaks on two different sanitarium hosts (db1154 and db1155): <icinga-wm> PROBLEM - MariaDB Replica SQL: s1 on db1154 is CRITICAL: CRITICAL slave_sql_state Slave_SQL_Running: No, Errno: 1032, Errmsg: Could not execute Delete_rows_v1 event on table enwiki.user_properties: Cant find record in user_properties, Error_code: 1032: handler error HA_ERR_KEY_NOT_FOUND: the events master log db1196-bin.001099, end_log_pos 654625806
*2023-05-25 05:18:  Manuel starts checking and communicates so on IRC
*2023-05-25 05:35: Incident opened by alert of broken replication.  Amir opens a task on Phabricator T337446 and the relevant teams and individuals tagged. Ways to mitigate this were explored, such as adding some transaction to get the replication flowing back but discarded as it would compromise data integrity.
*2023-05-25 05:47: Manuel tries to fix a row in s5, host crashes
*2023-05-25 05:51: Manuel: The first attempts to manually fix the rows result in the hosts crashing 
*2023-05-25 06:13: Fix row of S1 fails, host crashes
*2023-05-25 06:27: The decision to rebuild everything is made and work starts on sanitarium hosts
*2023-05-25 14:40: The initial for broken sections are done in sanitarium and start the sanitizing process.
*2023-05-26 05:10 Sanitarium host is still being worked on for s1,s2, s5 and s7
*2023-05-26 13:23 Manuel pings btullis on IRC and phabricator asking for data engineering to prioritize the outage
*2023-05-26 15:08 Cookbook cookbooks.sre.wikireplicas.update-views run by nskaggs: Started updating wikireplica views
*2023-05-26 16:50 Manuel calls for help on IRC from WMCS and other people who have owned or own the replicas to run cookbooks responsible for updating views. There’s some response but nothing gets done by the end of day.
*2023-05-26 replication on s3 section also breaks
Replication breaks again
*2023-05-27 05:12 replication on s1 section breaks again

*2023-05-29 05:08 <marostegui> I have had to kill them, it's been more than 24h waiting to stop. Going to downgrade + rebuild
*2023-05-29 05:32 recloning db1154:3311 db1154:3313 db1154:3315 db1155:3312 clouddb1021:3317
*2023-05-29 07:58 clouddb1021 (s7) has been recloned
*2023-05-29 08:08 Started to reclone 1014 and 1018
*2023-05-27 / 2023-05-28: More investigation about why the second breakage happened starts on phabricator and the decision to reclone everything again + downgrade is made (from 10.4.29 to 10.4.26)
Email sent to wikitech concerning outage
*2023-05-29 13:59 Email sent to wikitech-l about outage. 
*2023-05-29 14:21 s7 is fully recloned
*2023-05-29 14:35 clouddb1021:s2 is fully ready with views, grants, users etc
*2023-05-29 15:46 clouddb1021:s3 is fully ready with views, grants, users etc
*2023-05-29 16:52 And issue with dbproxy1018 and dbproxy1019 (WMCS wikireplicas proxies) and Healthcheck for unable wikireplicas overwhelm pybal, almost causing a general outage, is detected by Valentin but there is no more context on why this is happening. several extra steps have been missing on rebuilding cloud dbs documentations. Fixing that.
*2023-05-29 19:10 WMCS pinged again to help restore some missing tables, indexes and data because the Data Persistence team did not have enough context to proceed confidently.
*2023-05-29 21:59 A response is sent on another thread on the same subject to reassure users that work was ongoing to restore the replicas. Users complained about the lack of access to meta_p and heartbeat_p databases.
*2023-05-28 22:45: Replication lag in dewiki is mentioned on wikitech-l
*2023-05-30 04:38 Manuel detects s4 has broken too and manually fixes it inserting the missing row but will reclone later 
*2023-05-30 05:19 db1154 s4 fixed by inserting the missing row
*2023-05-30 06:33 s5 is fully recloned

*2023-05-30 09:59 https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T337721 is created to investigate the proxy issue affecting pybal
*2023-05-30 10:43 clouddb1021:3311 (s1) is fully ready with grants, views etc. Once it has caught up I will clone the other two s1 hosts.
*2023-05-30 12:56  IdleConnection monitor is disabled is disabled via https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/puppet/+/924342

*2023-05-30 14:34 Users complained that while the clouddbs are accessible and updated, they are extremely slow to query.  T337734 was filed and WMCS was pinged for help. It turned out that the script that’s adding indexes is broken, WMCS couldn’t figure out why. Amir started investigating, fixed and started running the script.
*2023-05-30 15:17 s2 is fully recloned
*2023-05-30 18:44 s3 is fully recloned and it is now catching up (it is 8h behind)

*2023-06-01 Amir finishes creating indexes using the fixed script.
Outage ends

==Conclusions ==

* mariadb version 10.4.29 maybe a replication bug - hard/impossible to reproduce
* wikireplicas is quite critical for the community although it's not considered a "production" service

===What went well?===

* Database operations, such as version downgrades or reclones are well known exercises and went well.

===What went poorly?===

* Database replication broke multiple times on different sections, needing manual troubleshooting and intervention
* Documentation of wikireplicas setup had missing pieces (like grants?) and is scattered across multiple places
* Troubleshooting the issue was difficult
* Databases (db1154) did not shut down properly
* Recloning a database takes a lot of time

===Where did we get lucky?===

* Not all database sections broke
** We could copy/check grants from those non-broken sections
* Amir was able to quickly fix the bit rotten indexing script

==Links to relevant documentation==



* S1 replication lag
* https://replag.toolforge.org, used to wiki replica lab 
* Wikitech Wiki Replicas documentation
* meta_p information
* Portal:Data Services/Admin/Wiki Replicas#Step 5: setting indexes
* Portal:Data Services/Admin/Wiki Replicas#Step 7: setting up metadata

==Actionables==

* Add more documentation of wikireplicas setup
* Alerting for wikireplicas lag
* Discuss SLO for wikireplicas and level of "production", per Leon Ziemba
** "I wanted to ask something I've genuinely been curious about for years -- since the wiki replicas are relied upon so heavily by the editing communities (and to some degree, readers), should we as an org treat their health with more scrutiny? This of course is insignificant compared to the production replicas going down, but nonetheless the effects were surely felt all across the movement (editathons don't have live tracking, stewards can't query for global contribs, important bots stop working, etc.). I.e. I wonder if there's any appetite to file an incident report, especially if we feel there are lessons to be learned to prevent similar future outages? I noticed other comparatively low-impact incidents have been documented, such as PAWS outages."
