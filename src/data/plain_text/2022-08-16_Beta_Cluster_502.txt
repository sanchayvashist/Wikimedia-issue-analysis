==Summary==

After an inadvertent restart of some WMCS cloudvirts and their associated VMs, all sites within the Beta Cluster (e.g. https://meta.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Main_Page) failed to load, with Error: 502, Next Hop Connection Failed — this persisted post-restart of the relevant VMs.

Drafting: possibly an apache config/puppet failure (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T315350#8159826), restarting trafficserver seems to have fixed it (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T315350#8159954)

The incident was complicated by the lack of Beta Cluster's maintenance meaning ongoing "normal" errors distracted from the cause.



==Timeline==
All times in UTC.

*2022-08-16 17:57 OUTAGE BEGINS: Uptime monitoring "pages" TheresNoTime, who informs #wikimedia-operations & #wikimedia-releng
**This coincides with the WMCS VM accidental restarts ([Cloud] [Cloud-announce] Some cloud-vps servers just rebooted)
*2022-08-16 18:21 T315350 logged
*2022-08-17 00:57 OUTAGE ENDS

==Detection==
* TheresNoTime has an uptime monitor at https://uptime.theresnotime.io/status/wmf-beta which "paged" her
* User reports
* CI errors from beta sync

==Conclusions==

===What went well?===

* A number of volunteers were available to triage
===What went poorly?===
* no paging/alerting surfaced on IRC, so minimal initial visibility
* lack of fast response from people with sufficient knowledge
* beta is already broken in weird and wonderful ways

===Where did we get lucky?===

* No deployments were affected
* Beta wasn't needed due to test/replicate production issues during the time.

(Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc

===How many people were involved in the remediation?===

* 3 Volunteers
* 2 Release Engineers
* 2 SRE - 1 Search Platform, 1 ServiceOps
* 1 WMCS admin


(Use bullet points) for example: 2 SREs and 1 software engineer troubleshooting the issue plus 1 incident commander

==Links to relevant documentation==

*…

Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.

==Actionables==

* logspam watch broken on beta 
* Remove two cherry-picked reverts from deployment-puppetmaster04 
* Rebase & merge or re-cherry-pick 668701 on deployment-puppetmaster04
* Replace certificate on deployment-elastic09.deployment-prep 
* Add basic alerting

Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.

Add the #Sustainability (Incident Followup) and the #SRE-OnFIRE (Pending Review & Scorecard)  Phabricator tag to these tasks.
