==Summary==

The service got overloaded and started to block client traffic, including Pybal which ultimately triggered the page.  Icinga sent some non-paging alerts at 13:50 but paging alerts didn't get sent until 16:52.

== Timeline ==

* 13:50 Icinga alerts about CRITICAL - CRITICAL - wdqs-heavy-queries_8888 - none paging
* 16:52 Icinga notifies about Wikidata Query Service wdqs eqiad - outage starts, paging
* 16:57 Icinga notifies about Wikidata Query Service wdqs eqiad - paging
* 17:02 Icinga notifies about Wikidata Query Service wdqs eqiad - paging
* 17:05 joe restarts wdqs1006
* 17:07 Icinga notifies about Wikidata Query Service wdqs eqiad - paging
* 17:07 load on wdqs1006 increases to 120
* 17:15 jbond tries to reach search team, contacted gehel
* 17:17 gehel comes online
* 17:21 jbond restart wdqs services (at gehels request) clusterwide (wdqs::public)
* 17:24 RECOVERY messages in -operations  - outage ends

* Fix required restarting the wdqs services on the cluster
sudo cumin -b 1 -s 1 O:wdqs::public 'systemctl restart wdqs-blazegraph wdqs-categories wdqs-updater'



==Actionables==

* To make that service stable is to re-architect and replace Blazegraph.  The Search team will discuss this and arrange follow up actions
* In the meantime, https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T293862 might help to improve the reliability of Blazegraph.
* Investigate if earlier alerts should page https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T303134
