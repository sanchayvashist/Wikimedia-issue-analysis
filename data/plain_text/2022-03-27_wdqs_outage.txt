==Summary==
WDQS in Codfw entered a state of deadlock that persisted until service restarts were performed. Note that WDQS eqiad was depooled at the time of the incident, reducing total capacity.

== Detailed Timeline ==



=== Leading up to the incident ===

The day before the actual incident, wdqs2002 dropped out of service due to its blazegraph process locking up. Note that while not ideal, this does happen somewhat regularly, usually without incident. However it's relevant to this incident because it reduced available capacity for when the "actual incident" began the following day.

==Actionables==

* To make that service stable is to re-architect and replace Blazegraph.  The Search team will discuss this and arrange follow up actions
* In the meantime, https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T293862 might help to improve the reliability of Blazegraph.
* As the service is fairly fragile, but recovers quickly after a restart, simple auto-remediation such as scheduled service restarts might be appropriate.
* Investigate if earlier alerts should page https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T303134
* As discussed here, the command-line utility jstack can detect deadlocks, and is installed on all wdqs hosts. Perhaps we can use it to monitor for these deadlocks.
* Update https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service/Runbook#Blazegraph_deadlock with the exact verbiage from the alerts and examples of what Grafana looks like during these outages.
