An increase in Score requests (musical note rendering) from Parsoid overwhelmed the Shellbox service. This was mitigated by allocating more k8s pods to Shellbox. The overload took place from 11:17 to 11:33.

From the Grafana dashboard, we see that a majority of requests took over 5,000ms (5s) instead of less the usual 10ms (0.01s), and for two minutes 11:25-11:27 requests actually failed with HTTP 503 instead.

From the Logstash dashboard, we measure approximately 35,000 failed requests during this time. Of which 99.9% were from Parsoid, for de.wikipedia.org requests that render musical notes through the Score extension. 26K received HTTP 503, and 9K received HTTP 504. The remaining 0.1% were edits or pageviews calling Shellbox for syntax highlighting.
