==Summary==


During a reimage operation, the cloudelastic Elasticsearch cluster lost a shard and went into red status, indicating data loss.

Until the data was restored, search results were incomplete on Cloudelastic. Restoration from production snapshots, using the previously understood and documented process, failed consistently, requiring a different approach to be devised which is why restoration was delayed by a month. Restoration was completed on 12 July. 

Documentation:

==Actionables==

*Restore data to cloudelastic
*Document cloudelastic cluster (what is its purpose, who are the stakeholders, etc)
*Document restore process
*Review monitoring for cloudelastic
*Inform stakeholders of the current situation

TODO: Add the #Sustainability (Incident Followup) and the #SRE-OnFIRE (Pending Review & Scorecard) Phabricator tag to these tasks.
