== Summary ==


…

A sudden spike in requests to shellbox-syntaxhighlight overloaded the service leading to slow response times and increased failures.

The majority of requests where originating from jobrunners and api_appservers.



==Timeline==
All times in UTC.

*09:00 OUTAGE BEGINS non paging alerts of failing http-api probes and api_appservers running out of idle workers where observed in #mediawiki-operations; Investigation started
*09:03 paging alert: (ProbeDown) firing: Service shellbox-syntaxhighlight:4014 has failed probes (http_shellbox-syntaxhighlight_ip4)
*09:05 shellbox-syntaxhighlight req/s increased from ~5 to ~70req/s
*09:05 shellbox-syntaxhighlight scaled up from 12 to 40 replicas
*09:09 Alerts recovering
*09:10 OUTAGE ENDS
*09:11 (CirrusSearchJobQueueBacklogTooBig) firing: CirrusSearch job topic eqiad.mediawiki.job.cirrusSearchLinksUpdate is heavily backlogged with 209k messages
*09:49 cirrusSearchLinksUpdate backlog was cleared
*09:54 shellbox-syntaxhighlight scaled back to 12 replicas

==Detection==

Initially detected by a human spotting alerts on IRC, closely followed by a page.

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* Problem spotted early and countermeasures where taken quickly
* One of the SREs paged knew how to increase the number of syntaxhighlight runners (it's not mentioned on Shellbox)

===What went poorly?===

* shellbox-syntaxhighlight was probably overloaded by our own services (jobrunners), but currently this is an assumption.

===Where did we get lucky?===

* The burst in requests was rather short

==Actionables==

* Figure out what caused the burst (there's a suggestion a template was changed leading to a lot of pages needing re-rendering at once)
* Document how to scale up shellbox runners? (or link to it from Shellbox)
