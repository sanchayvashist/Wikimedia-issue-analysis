}}Since the previous evening (April 25), the Telia link from Eqord to Eqiad was down due to a fiber cut. At 05:00 the next morning, a Telia maintenance began that took down our remaining transports from Eqord, to Codfw and Ulsfo. As a result, we were entirely unable to reach the Eqord networking equipment. There was no end-user impact since Eqord is a network-only location with end-user traffic for [[Codfw data center|Codfw]] and [[Ulsfo data center|Ulsfo]] naturally going there directly instead of via Eqord.
