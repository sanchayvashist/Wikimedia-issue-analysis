==Summary==


During regular maintenance, there was a (scheduled) loss of power redundancy on the codfw-A1 server rack around 14:32:00 UTC.

While the servers in this rack did not lose power (given a redundant power supply), they did fully lose network connectivity and thus effectively went down. This happened because the second power cable for the ASW network switch was not plugged all the way in, resulting in an unscheduled full loss of the switch for that rack, and hence the rack's network connectivity.

Happily, higher-level service redundancy worked as expected:
* regarding LVS, lvs2010 automatically took over from lvs2007, for CDN traffic to Codfw. There was a very temporary increase on response latency for on-the-fly Codfw requests until traffic stabilized.
* ns1 DNS server was automatically moved to Eqiad, should not have any user impact.
* Most A2 servers alerted about loss of power redundancy, but having 2 power supplies they didn't go down.
* App servers could have been affected more, latency-wise while they were automatically depooled, but they were not serving production traffic at this time as Eqiad is the primary DC.

After the secondary power cord was properly connected, connectivity recovered with no issues. Maintenance finished at 15:01.
