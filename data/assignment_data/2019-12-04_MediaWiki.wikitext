== Summary ==
Roll out of wmf.8 to group1 broke the world.

=== Detection ===
Initial indicators of the issue were picked up in logstash and via logspam-watch on mwlog1001.  A large number of Icinga alerts followed.

It seems likely that the primary issue was obscured during the initial deploy by a focus on Parsoid errors.

== Timeline ==
