==Summary==
Increased db load for enwiki (s1) resulted in slower responses, which in turn resulted in overall php-fpm worker limits being reached and thus affecting requests for all wikis. For requests above the limit, the error was "''upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: overflow''".

'''Impact''': For about 15 minutes, backend appservers were slower or unable to respond for all wikis. This mainly affected logged-in users and most bot/API queries. Some page views from unregistered users were affected, for pages that were recently edited or otherwise expired from the CDN cache.  

'''Documentation''':

* Similar to [[Incident documentation/2021-09-04 appserver latency]] and [[Incident documentation/2021-09-18 appserver latency]].
