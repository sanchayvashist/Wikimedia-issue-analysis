A wrong configuration change caused sessionstore pods to be unschedulable in our WikiKube cluster. This resulted in failed edits across all projects for a period of 9 minutes.

{{TOC|align=right}}

==Timeline==
''All times in UTC.''

12:15 '''OUTAGE BEGINS'''.  '''Alexandros''' becomes IC.

12:15 (ProbeDown) firing: Service sessionstore:8081 has failed probes (http_sessionstore_ip4) #page -

12:16 It becomes apparent that sessionstore is no longer serving requests, after an increase and some pod restarts

12:18 A correlation is made to a change for MatchNodeSelector for sessionstore

12:24 nodeAffinity for specific rack rows was removed manually from sessionstore deployments in k8s (basically <nowiki>https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/deployment-charts/+/867572</nowiki> was done manually via kubectl edit) '''OUTAGE ENDS'''

12:25 Incident created in wikimediastatus.net

12:27 Status page updated

12:30 Resolved

==Detection==
Automated monitoring detected the issue

(ProbeDown) firing: Service sessionstore:8081 has failed probes (http_sessionstore_ip4) #page -

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* The incident was immediately detected by automated monitoring and the problem was quickly identified and fixed.
* Multiple people responded
* An IC was appointed quickly

===What went poorly?===

* Incident status page was update at the end of the rather short incident.

===Where did we get lucky?===

* Nowhere?

The CR changed the typology zone annotation for Kubernetes Nodes running on Ganeti from something like “row-a” to “ganeti-eqiad-b”, referencing the Ganeti cluster name and group. With sessionstore Pods being only scheduled to specific rows it made them unschedulable in the cluster.
