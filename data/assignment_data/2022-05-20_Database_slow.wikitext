On 2022-05-14 at 8:18 UTC there was a 3 minute impact on uncached traffic (high latency, unavailability) related to application server worker thread exhaustion caused by slow database response. There was no clear root cause at the time. The incident occurred again on the same database host on 2022-05-20 at 09:35 UTC, this time lasting for 5 minutes. After further investigation the likely root cause is a MariaDB 10.6 performance regression under load, further researched in https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T311106.
