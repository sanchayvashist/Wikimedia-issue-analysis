Due to a uptream bug introduced in a firejail update, Thumbor constantly restarting itself. This lead to increased error rates, and also increased delays from the HAProxy in front of it.

==Detection==
<mark>Write how the issue was first detected.  Was automated monitoring first to detect it? Or a human reporting an error?</mark>

<mark>Copy the relevant alerts that fired in this section.</mark>

<mark>Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? Was the alert volume manageable? Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible?</mark>

<mark>TODO: If human only, an actionable should probably be to "add alerting".</mark>

==Actionables==

*…

<mark>Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.</mark>

<mark>Add the [[phab:project/view/4758/|#Sustainability (Incident Followup)]] and the [[phab:project/profile/4626/|#SRE-OnFIRE (Pending Review & Scorecard)]]  Phabricator tag to these tasks.</mark>
