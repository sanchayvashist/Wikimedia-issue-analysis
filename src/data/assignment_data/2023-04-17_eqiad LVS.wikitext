*14:04 PyBal disabled on lvs1019 as part of maintenance but a deploy was ongoing '''OUTAGE BEGINS'''
*14:05 PROBLEM - PyBal backends health check on lvs1019 is CRITICAL: PYBAL CRITICAL - Bad Response from pybal: 500 Cant connect to localhost:9090 (Connection refused) <nowiki>https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/PyBal</nowiki>

*14:25 recoveries coming in '''OUTAGE ENDS'''
*14:42 still elevated latencies on api_appservers, might be unrelated as there is a spike of read traffic on s7
*14:58 s7 query throughput is high due to db maintenance, most likely unrelated
*14:58 api_appserver latency trending down
*15:08] <jinxer-wm> (MediaWikiLatencyExceeded) resolved: Average latency high: ...

==Detection==
The issue was detected immediately by SRE doing maintenance work. Multiple alerts as well as pages immediately followed.

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* Automated alerting detected the issue quickly

===What went poorly?===

*We did not manage to avoid this happening again although we already knew about LVS downtime during scap deploys being an issue

===Where did we get lucky?===

* Remediation of the outage was quick due to its root cause already being known, see [[Incidents/2023-04-17 eqiad/LVS]]
