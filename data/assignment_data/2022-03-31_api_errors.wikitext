| metrics = No relevant SLOs exist. The API Gateway SLO was unaffected. If the planned app server SLO existed, we would have consumed a small portion of its error budget.
| impact = For 22 minutes, API server and app server availability were slightly decreased (~0.1% errors, all for s7-hosted wikis such as Spanish Wikipedia), and the latency of API servers was elevated as well.

After a code change [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/core/+/773915] [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/CentralAuth/+/773913] rolled out in this week's train, the GlobalUsersPager class (part of CentralAuth) produced expensive DB queries that exhausted resources on [[S7|s7 database]] replicas.

Backpressure from the databases tied up PHP-FPM workers on the API servers, triggering a paging alert for worker saturation. The slow queries were identified and manually killed on the database, which resolved the incident.

Because the alert fired and the queries were killed before available workers were fully exhausted, the impact was limited to s7. Full worker saturation would have resulted in a complete API outage.

Because only two engineers responded to the page and the response only took half an hour, we decided not to designate an incident coordinator, start a status doc, and so on. We didn't need those tools to organize the response, and they would have taken time away from solving the problem.

'''Documentation''':
* [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T305119 Phabricator task detailing the slow query]

==Actionables==

* Revert the patches generating the slow queries - done [https://sal.toolforge.org/log/J7Yi4H8Ba_6PSCT9nWWR] [https://sal.toolforge.org/log/Wigp4H8B8Fs0LHO5M3s9]
* Later (2022-04-06) it was discovered the query killer was using the old 'wikiuser' name, which prevented it from acting. Fixed in [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/software/+/777760], deploying soon.
