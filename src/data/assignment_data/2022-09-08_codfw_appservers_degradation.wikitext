An Nginx server restart (RC) triggered an <code>etcdmirror</code> outage that started affecting end-users during a subsequent MediaWiki deployment. The etcd outage led to php-fpm not being able to contact its configuration server and failing to restart for the deployment. The appservers got depooled because of the failure until pybal depool protection kicked in. When etcdmirror was restarted to resolve the restart issue, the configuration state with the depooled servers was synchronized, which triggered the depooling of 50% of codfw api-https, api_appserver, appserver, and parsoid servers.

==Detection==
<mark>Write how the issue was first detected.  Was automated monitoring first to detect it? Or a human reporting an error?</mark>

claime reports errors during scap sync-file, jayme picks up on conf2005/etcdmirror being in a CRITICAL state

<mark>Copy the relevant alerts that fired in this section.</mark>

15:22:02   +icinga-wm | PROBLEM - etcdmirror-conftool-eqiad-wmnet service on conf2005 is CRITICAL: CRITICAL - Expecting active but unit etcdmirror-conftool-eqiad-wmnet is failed

<mark>Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? Was the alert volume manageable? Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible?</mark>

Alert fired on IRC but no page went out.

<mark>TODO: If human only, an actionable should probably be to "add alerting".</mark>

==Conclusions==

<mark>OPTIONAL: General conclusions (bullet points or narrative)</mark>

===What went well?===

* RC very quickly identified due to akosiaris, _joe_, moritzm and jayme being around and correlating very quickly

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc</mark>

===What went poorly?===

* Scap continues deployment even in the face of rising failure rates once canaries are passed.
* Scap doesn't check the status of etcdmirrors before deployment.
* No documentation on what to do with scap deployment in the face of rising failure rates.
* The etcdmirror alert didn't page.

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc</mark>

===Where did we get lucky?===

*_joe_ thought to check the pybal config after the etcdmirror restart which allowed very rapid response to the depooling
*pybal depooling protection kicked in
*5 persons were online to assist and quickly correlated RCA

<mark>OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc</mark>

==Links to relevant documentation==

*…

<mark>Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.</mark>

==Actionables==

*[[phab:T317402|Page on etcdmirror alert]]
*[[phab:T317535|Add etcdmirror connection retry on etcd-tls-proxy unavailability]]
*[[phab:T317537|Update Etcd/Main cluster#Replication with safe restart conditions and information]]
*[[phab:T317403|Add etcdmirror status check to scap]]
*[[phab:T317405|Add failure rate triggered rollback to scap]]

<mark>Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.</mark>

<mark>Add the [[phab:project/view/4758/|#Sustainability (Incident Followup)]] and the [[phab:project/profile/4626/|#SRE-OnFIRE (Pending Review & Scorecard)]]  Phabricator tag to these tasks.</mark>
