== Summary ==


Hotlinking of an image on Commons caused link saturation in the eqsin datacentre. 



==Timeline==
Link to a specific offset in SAL using the SAL tool at https://sal.toolforge.org/ (example)

All times in UTC.

*10:47 Page for port utilisation arrives  OUTAGE BEGINS
*11:14: VictorOps page: DDos Detected (eqsin)
*12:01 hnowlan adds requestctl/request-actions/cache-upload/hotlink_from_jio_blomen.yaml and requestctl/request-patterns/req/cache_buster_nnn.yaml. No effect
*12:08 Incident opened. Kamila becomes IC
*12:33 hnowlan manually deploys varnish frontend rule 
*12:48 All damaging requests for URL in question are receiving HTTP 429 in response 
*12:39 <+jinxer-wm> RESOLVED: DDoSDetected: FastNetMon has detected an attack on eqsin #page - https://bit.ly/wmf-fastnetmon - https://w.wiki/8oU - https://alerts.wikimedia.org/?q=alertname%3DDDoSDetected OUTAGE ENDS

==Detection==
This incident was detected via paging for port utilisation in eqsin: 
<+jinxer-wm> FIRING: Primary outbound port utilisation over 80%  #page: Alert for device asw1-eqsin.mgmt.eqsin.wmnet - Primary outbound port utilisation over 80%  #page
Additionally FastNetMon detected what it perceived as a DDoS. This was more or less correct as the behaviours witnessed are similar to a simple DDoS attack.

==Conclusions ==
This was a somewhat familiar pattern, as we have seen similar issues in the past on a larger scale. 

===What went well?===

* ...

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: automated monitoring detected the incident, outage was root-caused quickly, etc

===What went poorly?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: documentation on the affected service was unhelpful, communication difficulties, etc

===Where did we get lucky?===

* …

OPTIONAL: (Use bullet points) for example: user's error report was exceptionally detailed, incident occurred when the most people were online to assist, etc

==Links to relevant documentation==

* …

Add links to information that someone responding to this alert should have (runbook, plus supporting docs). If that documentation does not exist, add an action item to create it.

==Actionables==

* …

Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.

Add the #Sustainability (Incident Followup) and the #SRE-OnFire  Phabricator tag to these tasks.
