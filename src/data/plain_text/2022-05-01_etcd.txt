==Summary==



The TLS certificate for etcd.eqiad.wmnet expired. Nginx servers on conf* hosts use this certificate, and thus conftool-data could not sync between conf hosts anymore. During this time, puppet-merge returned sync errors. labweb (wikitech) hosts alerted because of failed timers/jobs.

We got paged by monitoring of "Etcd replication lag". We had to renew the certificate but it wasn't a simple renew, because additionally some certificates had already converted to a new way or creating and managing them while others had not. Our two core data centers were in different states. Only Eqiad was affected by lag and sync errors. After figuring this out, we eventually created a new certificate for etcd.eqiad using cergen, copied the private key and certs in place and reconfigured servers in Eqiad to use it. After this, all alerts recovered.

==Actionables==
Create a list of action items that will help prevent this from happening again as much as possible. Link to or create a Phabricator task for every step.
