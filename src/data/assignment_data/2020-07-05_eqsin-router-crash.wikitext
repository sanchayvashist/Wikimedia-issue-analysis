== Summary ==
On Sunday 5th at 11:22UTC, the primary hard drive of cr3-eqsin (one of the two Singapore POP routers) crashed.
This caused the router to reboot into its second disk, containing only a factory default configuration. Everything failed over cleanly to the redundant router.

'''Impact''': We lost at max ~15000 requests/s in a 7min window (see screenshot, and [https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000479/frontend-traffic?panelId=2&fullscreen&orgId=1&from=1593943200000&to=1593953999000&var-site=eqsin&var-cache_type=text&var-cache_type=upload&var-status_type=1&var-status_type=2&var-status_type=3&var-status_type=4 graph]).

== Timeline ==
'''All times in UTC.'''

* 11:22 PROBLEM - Host cr3-eqsin is DOWN: PING CRITICAL - Packet loss = 100% (paging) '''OUTAGE BEGINS'''
* 11:25 SREs reports of connectivity issues to eqsin (too brief to trigger alerting)
* 11:27 Routing is done converging, no more reports of connectivity issue '''OUTAGE ENDS'''
* 11:35 DNS patch ready to depool eqsin (just in case, unused) - https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/dns/+/609571/

Monday 06
* ~07:40 Router is brought back up on its backup disk '''Redundancy restored'''

== Detection ==

* Was automated monitoring first to detect it? Yes
* Did the appropriate alert(s) fire? Yes
* PROBLEM - Host cr3-eqsin is DOWN: PING CRITICAL - Packet loss = 100% (paging alert)
* Was the alert volume manageable? Yes, only relevant alerts fired
* Did they point to the problem with as much accuracy as possible? Yes, the router went down, and only the router down paging alert triggered

== Conclusions ==
* This outage showed that our hardware redundancy and failover are solid
* Juniper recently introduced a new feature: <code>vmhost snapshot</code> that would have prevented the lack of redundancy (but not the crash itself)

=== What went well? ===
