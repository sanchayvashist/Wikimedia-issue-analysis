== Summary ==


All users of dawiktionary, dawiki, and svwiktionary sometimes received fatal exceptions while browsing.  Logs indicated MediaWiki was encountering a data  issue which also entered the object cache.  The source of the problem was traced back to a data migration implementation bug in how bash interprets double-quotes (") characters.



==Timeline==
All times in UTC.

*2023-05-31 15:45 low level of 500 errors on dawiktionary - data encoding migration begins: 
*2023-06-06 00:30 errors dramatically increase - OUTAGE BEGINS
*2023-06-06 01:35 UBN  filed
*2023-06-06 02:36 Problem escalated to SRE via Klaxon - investigation begins
*2023-06-06 03:36 Investigation yields possible data issue - Escalated to DBA running the encoding migration
*2023-06-06 03:49 Responding DBA detects and implements the fix - Client-facing errors stop - OUTAGE ENDS

==Detection==
The issue was noticed by a volunteer and reported after business hours via IRC.  Another volunteer saw the IRC message and escalated to SRE via Klaxon.

==Conclusions ==

===What went well?===

* Klaxon notified SRE and a number of engineers responded quickly.
* VO made it easy to escalate the issue to another engineer.
* Once a DBA arrived, the issue was fixed quickly and the root cause identified.
* We intentionally started with small wikis on legacy encoding. Dutch Wikipedia and English Wikipedia could have had the outage instead.

===What went poorly?===

* The problem surfaced inconsistently when running spot-checks.
* The problem resolution required deep technical knowledge of MediaWiki data formats and internal caching systems.

===Where did we get lucky?===

* It was early in the morning for them, but a DBA with the necessary expertise responded to the call when requested.
